Expensive...and after three months of daily use I can't say it has helped my blood pressure.

I record my blood pressure every morning at the same time...after getting up from nights sleep.

I use exercise equipment for 45 minutes after stretching exercises.  Then breakfast and 15 minutes on Resperate Devise.

My blood pressure hasn't changed significently in the last six months and I continue to take blood pressure medicine.

The Resperate Device was used for the first six weeks just before bedtime - change in schedule hasn't changed blood pressure measurments to any significant extent.

I continue to use the device because of the fortune spent on it but wouldn't consider buying it again

When I got this pedometer, I found that the instructions weren't clear.  I never did get the thing to work.  I have had pedometers before and they have always been easy to operate.  This one wasn't.  The pedometer doesn't cost enough to go through the hassle of returning it at your cost.  It's just easier to buy a new one.  However, I suggest that you purchase it in person from a sporting goods or health store

The pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell -- what are these "packaging engineers" thinking? It took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it, and then I took the scissors to it, and the hard packaging almost broke them!

But I was thrilled.  A handsome object, thought I, and I loved the clip in the back that you pinch to open.  So much better than having to wrestle it down over a soft waistband.  I yanked out the plastic battery protector and set to work to rev the thing up to speed.  But, alas, it would not follow instructions as they were written.  "Press and hold the Set button.  Hour display blinking."  (Could they not have said, "The hour display will blink"?  I pressed.  "Press Memory button to adjust the hour."  I did.  The Memory button never did a thing.  So I asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either.  We both tried several combinations of maneuvers, but nothing worked.  To this moment, the hour display is blinking, blinking, blinking.

I'd like to get my money back, but ya know what?  J & R Music & Computer World in NY demand such a rigamarole to send it back, including with all the original packaging (I threw the OP in the trash), that you almost have to be a genius in packaging to follow their instructions, which, of course, are not designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves.  Now I'm afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the trash, while I will make sure I never order from J&R again.

I was offered  one of these while cycling and thought it was very tasty.  So good, in fact, that when I got home I went straight to the web site show on the back of the wrapper to learn where I could buy them.  Just above the web address is the nutrition and ingredients list.  That was probably a mistake on the manufacturer's part as it gives you something to read while the site comes up.  OOPS!  This bar has a whooping 25% of your daily allowance of saturated fat!  Not only that, but the fat is palm oil.

This might be acceptable for a soldier involved in prolonged strenuous activity but I doubt a cardiologist would recomend it to most of us.  A commercially formulated product is more likely to fill the average person's need for a lower fat (and healthier fat) energy bar, than one formulated for extreme physical activity, sold for profit and marketed as a patriotic tribute to the troops.  Bottom line: Read the label, weigh the health risks and if you want to support the troops, there has to be a better way than eating Hooah Bars.

The best thing I can say about the test is it took 13 days to receive my results.

The actual results varied greatly from those I received from my doctor 3 months prior:

(...)

Both tests were taken following a 12-hour fast.  All instructions were followed.  I find it hard to believe my cholesterol levels changed so drastically in 3 months.  I contacted BioSafe customer service.   All representatives were busy on my first call so I left a message, which was not returned.  I called again and was able to speak to someone right away.  The customer service person was very pleasant and took a lot of time explaining how accurate their tests were and how results from different testing methods (finger prick vs. blood drawn from arm) will vary "slightly".   (...)  I question the accuracy of the biosafe results.

This pedometer is so much cheaper (~$7) than the typical decent ones (that go for about $18 - $20).. now I know it is for a reason.. the buttons are flimsy, the package looks very cheap, the one I bought and presented to a senior citizen - did not work, also found that the Sr Citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device.. terrible ergonomics/form factor.

Would recommend spending a bit more and getting the Omron/Oregon Sc  $18 pedometers - much better form factor, high reliability and quality

The monitor works really well. The functions are a bit limited from the perspective of calorie counting and fitness tracking. 

If you are looking for a good basic monitor, this is a great unit.

I don't know how this works because when I found that I would need to wear a chest band during exercise to make it work, I returned it. It isn't evident in the advert for this (or any other) heart-rate monitor. I guess I'll have to trust my sense of pain...

I am a 20 year user of several Remington products, but I must admit they missed the mark in improving this shaver.  The Remington ES-1000 Utra Smooth Bump Control Shaver was designed to replace the original (BMS) Black Man's Shaver which was discountinued several years ago.  I recently purchased and used the ES-1000 and was quite disappointed with its performance.  The ES-1000 performed so poorly that I had to use my BMS that I had purchase 20 years ago to remove facial hair the ES-1000 shaver could not and did not remove.  The product should be called "Ultra poor with a sandpaper finish."  The product needs to be put to death by using an ultra smooth bullet.  For anyone with curly hair problems, you may want to consider comparing this product against the Wahl 5-Star Series, Model # 8061.  I think you will find there is a major difference in the products

I had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews. I used the razor as directed in the instruction manual. The manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use. I used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse. I had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal. Do not buy this product

After using this product for about a month and a half, I began to get very high blood pressure readings (157/106).  My doctor took my BP on the same day and got 130/80, which I also got with my manual cuff.  I find that this machine tends to show a rapid pulse as well.

The only good thing about it is that you don't have to record your readings manually.  If they calibrate the machine properly, it would be a great thing, but I wasted my money

Be sure to measure your arm before purchasing... it's annoying to receive the unit with the Standard Adult Arm Cuff (fits arms 9 to 13 inches around) and find out I have to order a larger arm cuff!
Don't bother calling Omron "Customer Service" at 1-800-634-4350... just a typical big company voice mail hell! It even tells you to call another number to order the piece...
My 1 Star rating is only for the ordering information not provided and Omrons "customer service

In the user manual there is a whole list of people who it will provide inaccurate body fat percentage measurements for and body builders are one of them. I wish I had known this before. Now I have to waste about $20 in shipping to return it.

I am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging "palm kernel oil" as an ingredient.  Don't buy anything with palm kernel oil, cocoa butter, and anything hydrogenated!!  No matter how many "organic" things are added to it.

For many years now, it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease.  The World Health Organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases.

I had never eaten a Luna bar before I made this purchase, so I had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled. 

When I read "chocolate Pecan Pie" .. I expected just that.. the taste of rich chocolate, with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base.  What I received was a bar with little taste, nothing at all similar to the name on the bar. 

In my opinion, the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it... the flavor is barely there. The bar is dry. It is never again be on my "purchase" list

Amazon and this company are NIGHTMARES.  I ordered this scale a month ago, and the expected ship date keeps changing.  I finally called Amazon and dealt with the most ignorant customer service person ever.  He was no help at all.  After waiting on hold for about 20 minutes, he told me to call back because he was having a systems upgrade.  All he was able to give me was the ship date range, which has already changed several times.  Amazon needs to drop this from their website if they cannot do a better job with getting it out on time

Ordered this item on Sept 28. They were supposed to ship it within 1 week. After 1 week I received an email, they said they needed 2 more weeks. Another email today (Nov 7), they think they can deliver it by November 27. That's 2 months after I placed my order. At this point, I am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year. Fortunately with Amazon, they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order, which is what I am going to do right now

LCD fell off when arrived because the two-side sticker wasn't stong enough. Anyhow,I could push it back. Then, the scale couldn't be turned on by tapping on the top. This is the only way you can make this scale work as discribed on manual. I have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime! I think some force sensor attached to the frame is broken. This is the problem I can't fix.  The only thing I can do is sending it back. 
Following up: According to the other review, I tried to make this scale "vibrating" using different ways of tapping. It didn't work no matter how hard I tried. I had to use my toe to lift up one side a little (about half an inch) and drop it on hard floor to make enough "vibration" to turn it on. I wonder how long this scale can function well by such a way to switch on. My Soehnle scale always turns on by a soft tapping. I have to admit the reading of this scale is very clear and accurate. Just feel a little nervous standing on two pieces of glass. And also, be careful to use it in bathroom: moisture will make the glass surface slippery.

While I am not sure what exactly these do taste like, I don't detect the peanut butter here. The texture is good, chewy enough, but the taste is...odd. Not at all sweet. I can't imagine any child (or adult) grown accustomed to high fructose corn syrup actually enjoying these. Bleh. 

If you want peanut butter, the Clif Bar has a much better flavor (and an even denser, chewier texture). If you want a Z-Bar, I slightly recommend the chocolate--although it too tastes a bit odd and is inferior to the chocolate Clif Bars. Builder Bars are also worth a try, sufficiently sweet and flavorful. Of course, with these alternative product lines you will get about twice the calories. 

Although I will not buy these again, I give the company a star for a worthy effort

The reading magnifiers I ordered 09/29/04 finally arrived 10/19/04 after a call to the seller. (Original order was shipped to Amazon.com so it had to be reshipped to me.) It only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading magnifiers, and it is possible to adjust it to just about any position with the clever arm.  The weighted base does keep it from falling over. Unfortunately, the thin plastic lense is such poor quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the device.  If the user turned the adjustment knob too far, it and the nut that holds it together would fall off.  The nut is small and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to assemble the device.  The knob actually turns the nut onto the screw. Presumably the device is for someone with low vision.  If the small nut falls to the floor, I'm not sure someone with low vision would be able to find it.  My advice is to save your money and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens.... and if possible, try the device out before buying.

There are no energy drink ingredients in this stuff. It's sugar water with a miniscule amount of vitamin C.
A completely pathetic rip-off marketing hype which sadly is being sold as a troop supporting product. 
Supporting the troops should not involve buying garbage sugar water at high prices. If you want an energy drink try Rockstar or Monster. If you want to support the troops buy a savings bond

I own a more expensive Braun but bought this model as a gift for someone who I wasn't sure if he would use an electic toothbrush. After 7 months, the toothbrush won't turn off-something is shorted out. Unfortunately I no longer have the receipt. My more expensive model which I use multiple times a day has been problem free for over five years

Why are you paying such good money for a no-calorie water?! How many calories does water have to begin with?! It would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial(?a cheeseburger?). Please do NOT buy this. Fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to.... NO CALORIES! Give the money that you would have spend to charity. The makers of this water are thieves and con artists

This is the best diet product ever!  I tried them all and "SKINNY WATER?" is the easiest and cheapest diet idea ever.  The product taste great and it really removes any desire to eat too much.  I drink just 3 bottles a day and so far the pounds just melt away.  I lost 15 lbs. in 20 days.  Great taste, it works great, and it's so inexpensive.  Great job to who ever came up with the idea of drinking water and losing weight.  The owners should hire me to do commercials for them

Read some reviews that say "my cousin lost 100 pounds by drinking this water and walking a mile a day," and ask yourself - wouldn't that guy have lost the exact same weight drinking that much TAP WATER and walking a mile a day?!

This water is simply an attempt to fool gullible consumers into paying money for something with absolutely no value. If you won't drink water and exercise unless you have "special" water imbued with mythical powers, than by all means, this is the product for you. But if you prefer to save your money, simply exercise, eat healthier, and drink regular tap water

I've got this meter a month ago. I intended to use it to measure my pulse during exercise, but I've never been able to do so! At rest, the meter gives a reading after several attempts, but often inaccurate. You have to stay still as a statue for 10-20 seconds to get a reading. Now I'm using it as an exercise watch/stopwatch

The foil is a bit misleading, because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves (under the zipper) the timmer will catch you and it hurts, a lot. The foil can ONLY be used on straight surfaces. The two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle. If you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer.... well, be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa

I am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging "palm kernel oil" as an ingredient.  Don't buy anything with palm kernel oil, cocoa butter, and anything hydrogenated!!  No matter how many "organic" things are added to it.

For many years now, it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease.  The World Health Organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases.

     Although I have used many electronic cuff devices in the past, this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings. 

     Firstly, the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way.  

     In a clinical setting, it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings. It is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement. I have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what I considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way. Imagine had I taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result.

     As a rule, I never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings. Many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security.

     If you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting, please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions.

I purchased this unit and was dissatisfied with comparisons I made at the doctor's office. I next purchased an Omron arm unit and found the results to be more valid and reliable. The wrist unit is very cool, but did not live up to Consumer Reports suggestion that it had acceptable validity. I'm technically savvy, an excellent instructions follower, and really wanted to like this unit, but I cannot recommend it. Skip the cool wrist unit and get an arm unit if at all possible.

The Oral-B is a good product but the refills certainly aren't worth what they charge for them.  I don't know about you but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip-off price.  They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd.  The other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months.  That's a real laugh.  Even brushing just once a day, you're lucky if you get a month out of them.  So not only do they rip you off with their refill cost, they also lie to you to get you locked into their product to begin with

I bought this for a far-sighted relative, but it didn't magnify enough, and was distractinly blurry, so the gift wasn't well received.  I give this two thumbs down

I finally got this toothbrush after I have seen alot of people use them.  I am very disappointed.  The design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky.  It's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste.  It's very hard to clean.  It's loud, and small brush.  Not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive.  No thank you

I used this razor for a few months and was happy with everything except the price of the blades. I have always cut myself occasionally, but when I cut myself with the Fusion Power, I got this huge cut under my chin that eventually left a scar! Talk about sharp! I went back to using it and then a month or so later I cut myself AGAIN and this one was even worse. You could almost see five lines of blood on the point of my chin. I tossed the Fusion in the garbage, went back to the 3-blade, and wrote Gillette an e-mail to complain, to which they did not respond.

I've read all 60 reviews before mine, and was surprised to see that no one else reported this problem. Maybe it's my shaving technique, but this thing is a weapon

It never ceases to amaze me how often Gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it's loyal clientele.
 
The Fusion is a classic example, from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a Sensor Excel.

Don't buy into the hype, the Fusion is an expensive joke of a product.

like many other negative reviews, i've experienced the same problems with this razor.  i guess less blades is more and i'm going back to the m3 power.

i'll be brief about the problems:

1.  there's more "pulling" when you shave.  it felt like the hair on my face was being pulled out than cut.
2.  the razor is harder to clean off.
3.  i would get slight razor burn and i never get razor burn.
4.  it's more expensive than other better razors out there.

so there you have it.  if you HAVE to try it out, hey it might work for you.  but please, keep your receipt (and packaging) in case you want to get a refund.*

*  if you're reading this is 2009, chances are that gillette's money back guarantee will no longer be around.  however, there will probably be a gillette razor with 12 blades by then

I was so excited about this product; but when I got it I was deeply dissatisfied.  The box was damaged.  It was bent inward at the lid on one side and around the drawers opening it was ripped on both sides.  I will be returning this product for a replacement.  I do think that the box is really cute.  However if I receive another damaged box then I will never buy another thing from this website

The bars look like mudpies, are very dry, and all three "flavors" taste the same, meaning that they don't have much flavor at all. I much prefer certain flavors of Balance bars. The only good thing about these Clif bars is that I don't get hungry for several hours after eating one

This product is worthless. Save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else. 

I've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank. I'm really surprised that Amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in

My husband purchased the Pedometer with FM radio for me.  I loved it and used it non-stop for about a week.  After a week the battery case top fell off so I could not keep the batteries in.  The FM radio worked only once - I thought I had a short in the headset.  Good idea but really did not perform/last for the money

I wanted to buy this for my daughter. I wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill-ins with my new scrapbooking hobby. The outside is precious, but once you open it, the pages are like a black and white newspaper material, and they have no structure what so ever. The pages are boring and don't look very durable

What a disappointment!  The device just wasn't predictable.  Sometimes it would do as expected, sometimes not.  It was just a crapshoot.  Finally unplugged it and it's in a drawer somewhere.  Yes, I played with the sensitivity with no success.  Getting up to turn lights on and off was far less effort and aggravation than trying to convince The Clapper to do its thing.  Save your money and look elsewhere

Enough single-use garbage diapers are used in the U.S. each year to reach to the moon and back.  Think about where they come from and where they go.  What kind of world do you want your kids to live in? 
Cloth diapers are not difficult, and regardless of the propoganda of the garbage diaper companies, they have no where near the negative environmental impact.

Amazon and this company are NIGHTMARES.  I ordered this scale a month ago, and the expected ship date keeps changing.  I finally called Amazon and dealt with the most ignorant customer service person ever.  He was no help at all.  After waiting on hold for about 20 minutes, he told me to call back because he was having a systems upgrade.  All he was able to give me was the ship date range, which has already changed several times.  Amazon needs to drop this from their website if they cannot do a better job with getting it out on time

Ordered this item on Sept 28. They were supposed to ship it within 1 week. After 1 week I received an email, they said they needed 2 more weeks. Another email today (Nov 7), they think they can deliver it by November 27. That's 2 months after I placed my order. At this point, I am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year. Fortunately with Amazon, they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order, which is what I am going to do right now

LCD fell off when arrived because the two-side sticker wasn't stong enough. Anyhow,I could push it back. Then, the scale couldn't be turned on by tapping on the top. This is the only way you can make this scale work as discribed on manual. I have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime! I think some force sensor attached to the frame is broken. This is the problem I can't fix.  The only thing I can do is sending it back. 
Following up: According to the other review, I tried to make this scale "vibrating" using different ways of tapping. It didn't work no matter how hard I tried. I had to use my toe to lift up one side a little (about half an inch) and drop it on hard floor to make enough "vibration" to turn it on. I wonder how long this scale can function well by such a way to switch on. My Soehnle scale always turns on by a soft tapping. I have to admit the reading of this scale is very clear and accurate. Just feel a little nervous standing on two pieces of glass. And also, be careful to use it in bathroom: moisture will make the glass surface slippery.

The reading magnifiers I ordered 09/29/04 finally arrived 10/19/04 after a call to the seller. (Original order was shipped to Amazon.com so it had to be reshipped to me.) It only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading magnifiers, and it is possible to adjust it to just about any position with the clever arm.  The weighted base does keep it from falling over. Unfortunately, the thin plastic lense is such poor quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the device.  If the user turned the adjustment knob too far, it and the nut that holds it together would fall off.  The nut is small and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to assemble the device.  The knob actually turns the nut onto the screw. Presumably the device is for someone with low vision.  If the small nut falls to the floor, I'm not sure someone with low vision would be able to find it.  My advice is to save your money and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens.... and if possible, try the device out before buying.

I am a 20 year user of several Remington products, but I must admit they missed the mark in improving this shaver.  The Remington ES-1000 Utra Smooth Bump Control Shaver was designed to replace the original (BMS) Black Man's Shaver which was discountinued several years ago.  I recently purchased and used the ES-1000 and was quite disappointed with its performance.  The ES-1000 performed so poorly that I had to use my BMS that I had purchase 20 years ago to remove facial hair the ES-1000 shaver could not and did not remove.  The product should be called "Ultra poor with a sandpaper finish."  The product needs to be put to death by using an ultra smooth bullet.  For anyone with curly hair problems, you may want to consider comparing this product against the Wahl 5-Star Series, Model # 8061.  I think you will find there is a major difference in the products

I had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews. I used the razor as directed in the instruction manual. The manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use. I used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse. I had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal. Do not buy this product

There are no energy drink ingredients in this stuff. It's sugar water with a miniscule amount of vitamin C.
A completely pathetic rip-off marketing hype which sadly is being sold as a troop supporting product. 
Supporting the troops should not involve buying garbage sugar water at high prices. If you want an energy drink try Rockstar or Monster. If you want to support the troops buy a savings bond

I don't know what those other people were talking about but this energy drink tastes like melted popsicles. It's basically just Gatorade with more sugar in it. If you want an energy drink instead of a sweetened sports drink you should look elsewhere

I am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging "palm kernel oil" as an ingredient.  Don't buy anything with palm kernel oil, cocoa butter, and anything hydrogenated!!  No matter how many "organic" things are added to it.

For many years now, it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease.  The World Health Organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases.

I had never eaten a Luna bar before I made this purchase, so I had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled. 

When I read "chocolate Pecan Pie" .. I expected just that.. the taste of rich chocolate, with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base.  What I received was a bar with little taste, nothing at all similar to the name on the bar. 

In my opinion, the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it... the flavor is barely there. The bar is dry. It is never again be on my "purchase" list

Why are you paying such good money for a no-calorie water?! How many calories does water have to begin with?! It would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial(?a cheeseburger?). Please do NOT buy this. Fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to.... NO CALORIES! Give the money that you would have spend to charity. The makers of this water are thieves and con artists

Read some reviews that say "my cousin lost 100 pounds by drinking this water and walking a mile a day," and ask yourself - wouldn't that guy have lost the exact same weight drinking that much TAP WATER and walking a mile a day?!

This water is simply an attempt to fool gullible consumers into paying money for something with absolutely no value. If you won't drink water and exercise unless you have "special" water imbued with mythical powers, than by all means, this is the product for you. But if you prefer to save your money, simply exercise, eat healthier, and drink regular tap water

I bought it new. After using this shaver a couple of times in a shower, it stopped working. I took it to a Braun affiliated repair shop. Braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior, including the electronics. They said this is NOT a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me. 

I checked the manual before I used the shaver in the shower - it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower. I have not opened the shaver, I have not cleaned it in water. 

Thus, based on my experience, this shaver and Braun are a scam as far as I am concerned

I've got this meter a month ago. I intended to use it to measure my pulse during exercise, but I've never been able to do so! At rest, the meter gives a reading after several attempts, but often inaccurate. You have to stay still as a statue for 10-20 seconds to get a reading. Now I'm using it as an exercise watch/stopwatch

This device is useless for monitoring pulse during activity.  One must be absolutely still for the meter to get a clear signal.  Nor is it useful for monitoring resting pulse, as it seems unable to pick up a pulse unless the heart is pounding.  At best, this device MIGHT manage to acurately read a pulse AFTER a strenuous activity is concluded

     Although I have used many electronic cuff devices in the past, this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings. 

     Firstly, the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way.  

     In a clinical setting, it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings. It is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement. I have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what I considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way. Imagine had I taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result.

     As a rule, I never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings. Many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security.

     If you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting, please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions.

Expensive...and after three months of daily use I can't say it has helped my blood pressure.

I record my blood pressure every morning at the same time...after getting up from nights sleep.

I use exercise equipment for 45 minutes after stretching exercises.  Then breakfast and 15 minutes on Resperate Devise.

My blood pressure hasn't changed significently in the last six months and I continue to take blood pressure medicine.

The Resperate Device was used for the first six weeks just before bedtime - change in schedule hasn't changed blood pressure measurments to any significant extent.

I continue to use the device because of the fortune spent on it but wouldn't consider buying it again

Purchased this machine for my wife (born 1949) who has high blood pressure (150+/90+ untreated) and Type-II diabetes. Had high hopes as this was not a drug-related therapy. But was vastly disappointed by lack of positive results. Yes, she enjoyed using it. But her blood pressure was not improved.

HERE IS MY ANALYSIS for your consideration. If your high plood pressure is caused by stress and the cares of life, RESPeRATE may work for you. But there is no mechanism by which it can address or cure arteriosclerosis. So, carefully analyze the cause of your high blood pressure before buying

All this box does is make tones to slow down your breathing. I looked at it for a long time, I never found a clear explanation of what it actually is.  So I tried it and it seems like it should cost about $11.99. Save your money

When I got this pedometer, I found that the instructions weren't clear.  I never did get the thing to work.  I have had pedometers before and they have always been easy to operate.  This one wasn't.  The pedometer doesn't cost enough to go through the hassle of returning it at your cost.  It's just easier to buy a new one.  However, I suggest that you purchase it in person from a sporting goods or health store

The pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell -- what are these "packaging engineers" thinking? It took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it, and then I took the scissors to it, and the hard packaging almost broke them!

But I was thrilled.  A handsome object, thought I, and I loved the clip in the back that you pinch to open.  So much better than having to wrestle it down over a soft waistband.  I yanked out the plastic battery protector and set to work to rev the thing up to speed.  But, alas, it would not follow instructions as they were written.  "Press and hold the Set button.  Hour display blinking."  (Could they not have said, "The hour display will blink"?  I pressed.  "Press Memory button to adjust the hour."  I did.  The Memory button never did a thing.  So I asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either.  We both tried several combinations of maneuvers, but nothing worked.  To this moment, the hour display is blinking, blinking, blinking.

I'd like to get my money back, but ya know what?  J & R Music & Computer World in NY demand such a rigamarole to send it back, including with all the original packaging (I threw the OP in the trash), that you almost have to be a genius in packaging to follow their instructions, which, of course, are not designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves.  Now I'm afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the trash, while I will make sure I never order from J&R again.

This pedometer is so much cheaper (~$7) than the typical decent ones (that go for about $18 - $20).. now I know it is for a reason.. the buttons are flimsy, the package looks very cheap, the one I bought and presented to a senior citizen - did not work, also found that the Sr Citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device.. terrible ergonomics/form factor.

Would recommend spending a bit more and getting the Omron/Oregon Sc  $18 pedometers - much better form factor, high reliability and quality

Pros: it's really cheap, and has a lot of features (set stride length, calories, clock, backlight, protective door)

Con: the door is really, incredibly, intolerably hard to open.  I was adding a dozen steps to the readout just trying to get the door open.  I tried to trim the plastic tab, but I took too much off, now the door flops open.  It was useless the way it came from the factory, now I broke it and can't use it at all without a rubber band to keep it closed.
Also, I was never able to get a very accurate step-count.  I would count 100 steps and usually get 65-90 steps on the readout, though I'm not really sure because I had to shake the thing for a minute or two just to get the door open.

For the price, I think this would be a great deal for someone with the patience to work with it

The Oral-B is a good product but the refills certainly aren't worth what they charge for them.  I don't know about you but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip-off price.  They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd.  The other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months.  That's a real laugh.  Even brushing just once a day, you're lucky if you get a month out of them.  So not only do they rip you off with their refill cost, they also lie to you to get you locked into their product to begin with

I finally got this toothbrush after I have seen alot of people use them.  I am very disappointed.  The design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky.  It's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste.  It's very hard to clean.  It's loud, and small brush.  Not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive.  No thank you

In the user manual there is a whole list of people who it will provide inaccurate body fat percentage measurements for and body builders are one of them. I wish I had known this before. Now I have to waste about $20 in shipping to return it.

The scale part works fine, but the fat % measurement does not work. If you care about fat%, I'd recommend using the hand held device instead. It gives more accurate reads.

Wow 5 blades instead of three? Who would have thought of that? I smell noble price here! 
Don't let the great cosmetic design fool you. It turned out to be the same thing but with more blades. 
I was really excited waiting for my brand new Fusion Power razor to arrive, I am allergic to shaving so this was a big issue for me. After the first shave my hopes were destroyed. It turned out to be about the same thing. They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face.  The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance.
I hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development, instead of investing it in marketing.
By the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn't test this feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal.
What will be next, let me guess, 7 blades? I guess that these guys should really start working in something new because the "adding more blades" thing is getting exhausted.

    The first shave seemed good; but the second time did me in with the Fusion. Instead of just one nick, I managed around 3 or 4 nicks at once. But looking at the cost of the replacement cartridges put me into a state of price shock. 
   I got a Merkur Heavy Duty double edge safety razor & the blades are a huge savings. Merkur blades or Feather double edge blades average 50 cents apiece. The Feather blades are extremely sharp!
   The Gillette Sensor is more practical for me when in a big hurry. A good old fashioned shave using the double edge safety razor, a badger hair shaving brush, & some Proraso shave cream in the tube is alot more enjoyable & relaxing for me!

I used this razor for a few months and was happy with everything except the price of the blades. I have always cut myself occasionally, but when I cut myself with the Fusion Power, I got this huge cut under my chin that eventually left a scar! Talk about sharp! I went back to using it and then a month or so later I cut myself AGAIN and this one was even worse. You could almost see five lines of blood on the point of my chin. I tossed the Fusion in the garbage, went back to the 3-blade, and wrote Gillette an e-mail to complain, to which they did not respond.

I've read all 60 reviews before mine, and was surprised to see that no one else reported this problem. Maybe it's my shaving technique, but this thing is a weapon

It never ceases to amaze me how often Gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it's loyal clientele.
 
The Fusion is a classic example, from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a Sensor Excel.

Don't buy into the hype, the Fusion is an expensive joke of a product.

like many other negative reviews, i've experienced the same problems with this razor.  i guess less blades is more and i'm going back to the m3 power.

i'll be brief about the problems:

1.  there's more "pulling" when you shave.  it felt like the hair on my face was being pulled out than cut.
2.  the razor is harder to clean off.
3.  i would get slight razor burn and i never get razor burn.
4.  it's more expensive than other better razors out there.

so there you have it.  if you HAVE to try it out, hey it might work for you.  but please, keep your receipt (and packaging) in case you want to get a refund.*

*  if you're reading this is 2009, chances are that gillette's money back guarantee will no longer be around.  however, there will probably be a gillette razor with 12 blades by then

Until I bought several weeks worth of Rayovac Alkaline D cells, I used Duracell Alkaline D cells.  

Every week I run a 3-CD changer (JVC _CX-XC370) for 11 hours worth of water aerobic classes, at the same volume level (Volume #10), from Tuesday to Thursday.  The Duracells lasted all 11 hours (and might last even longer).  In contrast, these Rayovac D cells for the last three weeks (maybe four weeks) have consistently  died during the second half of the next-to-last class (after hour 9.5 and before hour 10).

I took Passion RX because I am 31 years old and have a very low sex drive and no passion. I had great success the first week I took this product. In fact I was so pleased, I bought 2 more bottles. However, the second week, I went back to having no sex drive. And even though I am continuing to take Passion RX, it has not had any effect whatsoever since the first week.  I take 2 pills each day in the morning, and have done so for over a month.  I suppose everyone is different but I won't purchase any more. Plus I just saw a webpage from Consumer Health Digest that gives it low rating compared to other products: http://consumerhealthdigest.com/top25female.htm?source=overute/Passionrx&OVRAW=passion%20rx&OVKEY=passion%20rx&OVMTC=standar

The bars look like mudpies, are very dry, and all three "flavors" taste the same, meaning that they don't have much flavor at all. I much prefer certain flavors of Balance bars. The only good thing about these Clif bars is that I don't get hungry for several hours after eating one

I was very careful to not press down as instructed when cleaning CDs, yet I was left with light circular scratches and smudges untouched.

As for scratches, you may as well use toothpaste for all the good this will do you. The solution does not fill in even the lightest scratches. I tried it with several different scatches and discs and the result was the same. Multiple applications fared no better.

The disc I bought this for primarily is in worse shape than when I started

This is the second one of these I've owned...my first one the screen went blank after about a month and a half...not an uncommon problem with this, I can see reading the other reviews...But I thought maybe it was just a problem with that particular pedometer, so I bought a second one...Big mistake!

As far as the radio, what a piece of crap.  I live about 20 minuters' drive from downtown Houston...maybe there are too many radio stations around here.  It just won't lock on to anything, not even the strongest stations.  Tons of static and stations fading in and out.  I bought a pedometer with a radio because I wanted a radio while I walked.  If you're selling a pedometer with a radio, the radio should work.

I would give this 0 stars if I could

This product is worthless. Save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else. 

I've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank. I'm really surprised that Amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in

I wanted to buy this for my daughter. I wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill-ins with my new scrapbooking hobby. The outside is precious, but once you open it, the pages are like a black and white newspaper material, and they have no structure what so ever. The pages are boring and don't look very durable

I loved the idea of the Clapper. I live alone so the clapping sound wouldn't bother me and I looked forward to the convenience factor. My first Clapper lasted about 4 months and then mysteriously stopped working, but the dead unit did smell suspiciously funny - like an electrical short.
Did I learn my lesson? Oh, no! I went ahead and purchased another Clapper some months later. The night before last, the lamp I connected this one to started blinking. I checked the lightbulb and it was OK. It was only went I got down close to the Clapper plugged into the outlet that I heard the dreaded sizzling sound and saw a flash of electricity. Once again the Clapper crapped out, this time in a different lamp, different outlet. Will I never learn?
Thank goodness nothing happened due to the highjinks of this faulty device. Can you say "housefire"? Again, how dumb am I? Is the unit UL-approved and, if so, have any other complaints been lodged about it? How does one find this out?
I like my gadgets, but "buyer beware" on this one

These wipes are very rough.  We bought these when our daughter was first born and I ended up not using them on her because she would scream everytime I used them.  If your baby has sensitive skin I would recommend the Huggies Newborn or the Huggies supreme wipes.  Wipe your face with one and you will see how scratchy they are.  Imagine how your baby's bottom feels afterward

Oprah Winfrey and Kevin Costner the leading medical researchers in America think this is a great break through. Well gee, if they like it you must too. There is no scientific basis other than the nice school teachers "guarantee" that this works. After you pay 5-6 bucks for some fizzing tablets that taste kind of good you might think something is happening. Well it probably is, in your psyche. If that and Kevin Costner testimonials do it for you then go ahead. Can't seem to find the "guarantee" on their web site other than they will do their darndest to improve the product and you'll be the first to benefit

I paid $45 for this aesthetically pleasing scale.  Sure it looks nice, but if it doesn't do its job, it's not much of an accessory for the bathroom.

It took me a while to figure out how the scale works.  There are a lot of beeps involved.  Essentially, to program your info, you start by pressing 
the mode button, adjust your height, press mode, adjust your age, press mode, select your gender, press mode, select between normal and athlete, press mode and you will hear a beep to confirm. Then to store, press either the up button for memory #s 1,3 and 5 or the down button for #s 2,4 and 6, press mode and there will be another beep to confirm.

Still with me?  If you just want your weight, you just step on the scale, but if you want to get your body fat and water %, you must press the up or down button to find your memory #, then press mode and wait for the beep before you step on the scale.

Now I don't know about you, but this procedure is a lot more cumbersome than any other scale I owned.  So fine, I've now figured out how to work the thing.  Getting even somewhat accurate results are another thing.

When I stepped on the scale, I would sometimes be surprised by the weight.  I didn't think I could gain 7 pounds in one day (I eat very healthy and my weight range is usually between 3-4 pounds).  But if you step on the scale again, like some other digital scales, it seems to remember your last weight and won't give you your real weight.  So I have to put some other object on it to get a reading and then the scale resets.  I step on the scale again and my weight is now 6 pounds less than the original reading!

The body water % didn't fluctuate too much and the body fat % was 3% higher than the reading on the last scale I owned (Conair Thinner brand).  

All in all, I am returning this scale and going back to the drawing board in finding something that is even the least bit accurate.

The slippers look nice and smell great.  They were difficult for me to get on my feet.  The lining was too restrictive.  Once they were on, they were very awkward and uncomfortable to take any steps. It's unlikely that I will ever use them on my feet.  I will only use the inserts for aromatherapy

The item pictured here is not what you will receive. You will receive a different model that has a different external and possibly internal design. Most important is that the model you get will NOT have the little orange change filter indicator. This very important feature takes the guess-work out of when to change the filter. Don't buy this item from this seller if you expect to get what is pictured. Thanks, pj-berk

I bought this with the notion that I would be receiving what was pictured: the filters that have a built in replacement gauge.  OOPS!  What I ended up with was the cheaper, replace every two month whether they need it or not filters.  Oh well, whats a little customer service when there's a buck to be made.  Not like it's FALSE ADVERTISING TO SEND PEOPLE A CHEAPER PRODUCT THEN WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GETTING

It is a great disappointment with Amazon when it pushed to sell a product, WES9006PC replacement inner blade and outer foil combination for pro curve linear shavers without indicating that they are not compatible with the Panasonic ES8162S Pro Curve Elite Convex Wet/Dry shaver I purchased. Amazon displaced those two products next to each other as though if I made a purchase those products together I would save money. Now I was forced to buy one more shaver that would be compatible with WES9006PC replacement.

I bought this from ioniczone themselves. IT does not work.
I kept it on for an entire month, the filter was never dirty at all.
Also, this unit is extremely small, the pic is rather misleading

I was however able to return the unit to the office in NV, had to make 2 phone calls and the person was very polite.

I went on to buy one from IonicPro,and what a difference it was, filters requires cleaning every 10 days or so and it was really dirty.

This product has not been certified that the harmful mercury has been distilled out.

By chance I read an article today in the Jan. 16 issue of Time by Andrew Weil, M.D. He advises strongly that fish oil be mercury free. Weil also lists the mercury free fish species to buy. He recommends Anarctic krill oil. Amazon has it but it is expensive. 

I guess I'll throw out the almost full bottle of Nature Made. Read up on it. Mercury is bad stuff

I own a Swiffer Wet Jet, and I am sorry I wasted my money. I don't know how effective this is on other surfaces, but I use it for my Brazilian Chestnut Hardwood Floors. Along with the cleaning solution that Swiffer markets for Hardwood. I use this product exactly as instructed and my beautiful hardwood floors costing over $40,000 come up with smears and smudges like you wouldn't believe. I realize that this is a cheap quick fix for dirty floors, but when you add in the fact that you contnually have to buy pads and cleaning solutions, it really isn't all that inexpensive the ONLY thing this product has gong for it is it's convienence, and technically, since I have to go over all of the floors again after using it to get rid of the smears and smudges, it really isn't that convienient either. So really this product is a BIG DUD for Hardwood floors at least.

When I bought this I had gotten sick of using a mop and bucket and really needed something faster. It doesn't cut it for a few reasons:

1. Solution left a streaky, dull floor. Mop & Glo with water works MUCH better.

2. Bottle only lasted 3 times for a very small kitchen.

3. Need to put batteries in the device (something I didn't realize when I bought it).

4. Not "cleaner than a mop." If you have a heavy-traffic floor like I do, you'd have to use about 3 clean pads on the floor to keep from pushing dirt around. A mop at least can be rinsed.

5. Bottle is impossible to refill. I might have stuck with it if I could have replaced the solution with a water/Mop & Glo mix, but they have the bottle fixed so you can't.

*sigh* I'm actually considering spending the $$$ for a "Scooba." We have a Roomba vac for the living room and it is a dream. If you want something fast, stick with "Swiffer Wet." No batteries, no solution to refill

I've got a small bit of hardwood space in my apartment, and I figured this would suit my mopping needs.  It hasn't.

Even after sweeping the area multiple times prior to using the WetJet, I've found that it doesn't really pick any dirt up.  What I wind up with is a polished floor with a lot of small piles of dirt everywhere.  I'm even using the "special" hardwood floor solution- it isn't making a difference.  I don't recommend this product for anything other than polishing a floor (and there are probably better solutions for that as well)

I bought this cushion because I had to move from California to New York and expected the drive to be torture on my back. I researched these types of cushions and decided to get this one because it has a lot of motors compared to cheaper units, and because I had recently bought a Mogu pillow and really liked the soft feel of it--this cushion has "Sqush," which has a similar feel.The cushion has a middle portion of Sqush which is concentrated into 3 "lumps"--at your shoulders, lower back, and under the front part of your thighs, near your knees. The lumps are soft and squishy and are covered in a spandex-like material. The rest of the cushion feels like fleece.When I first plugged it in, I was immediately disappointed in the weakness of the wimpy motors. Even at the highest intensity (I never even bother with the lower two), it felt like nothing more that a moderate vibration--definitely not enough to un-knot an aching back. The pre-set programs are fine but I rarely use them. It comes with straps but I had a hard time trying to install it in my car because the instructions were non-existent and it wasn't intuitive at all. I ended up just attaching them to some hardware on the underside of the chair, which worked well.I can't decide if the cushion made the drive any more bearable. The lower back cushioning filled my lumbar region fine but the shoulder padding must be too thick because it pushed my shoulders forward and forced me into a slight hunched position which strained my back and made it hurt. The thigh cushioning made it slightly difficult to slide into the seat because it effectively raises the level of the seat (my car doesn't have fancy seat controls) and I had to wedge myself into the seat. The massaging feature was helpful because it was a fun thing to do on a boring drive and it helped a little to keep the circulation going, but it simply wasn't powerful enough to be really effective. The worse thing is that the thigh motor DIED only a few hours into my trip!! It has a 2 year warranty, but you have to pay a $5 "handling" fee! I'm mad at myself for throwing away the box because if I hadn't, I'd return it to Amazon and wash my hands of it.Overall, this cushion is underpowered, unreliable, and not as orthopedically correct as it should be. It is definitely not worth the outrageous price. I regret not buying a simple lumbar cushion instead. I wish I had saved my money for Homedic's highly rated Shiatsu seat cushion instead, although I'm somewhat leary of their product reliability now

I bought this monitor because it was affordable and I thought it would be an easier and faster way to check my BP regularly.  It is easy to use, but I got much different readings than the readings I got from my arm cuff, the Dr and several other sources. I returned it and will stick with what works for me

This thing is unbelievably lame. It doesn't massage. It vibrates. Y'all have sat in massage chairs before at Sharper Image or Brookstone. They can be really good, with kneading balls that roll around giving a surprisingly deep back massage.

This thing doesn't even resemble those chairs. Trust me. I am sitting in one now. It is my main office chair. I have not turned on the "massage" function, or even plugged it in, since about three days after I bought it.

The "massage" feature is more like an annoy feature. It just shakes you around a bit, but doesn't actually feal good in any way.

Old Spice is a great-smelling cologne and I've worn it for years. My dad wore it when I was growing up and I remember he almost always smelled of it. It's a great cologne for lean, athletic guys who love retro; it's been around for decades and is a classic for masculine men. It takes a certain type of guy to pull off wearing the stuff. The smell really draws attention to a guy so he better keep his body hard and fit if he wants that type of attention, otherwise he'll just be annoying. Old Spice Cologne actually smells better if you let it age in the bottle for a long time; exposing it to heat helps to age it (leave a bottle in the car or attic in the summertime or outside in your tool building). Trust me, it smells awesome if you let it age. I meant to rate this a five star but hit the wrong toggle. I'm proud to say I'm carrying on the tradition of wearing Old Spice cologne. It's  not nerdy and it's not just for older men. It's a cologne for any masculine guy. It smells great

I bought this to save money and time on trips to the barber every two weeks for my son's fast growing hair.  He's got thick hair that we like to keep "buzzed" short.  The first time I used the clippers, he complained that they really pull at the hair.  I realized they were jamming up with each strip of hair I buzzed.  The little trimmer that is included never jammed but still pulled at his hair.  I've decided to send it back.  Reasonably priced but not worth the pain.  NOT RECOMENDED FOR THICK HAIR

So I bought two of these bottles, got them home, and discovered the first time I used them that every time you take a sip of water, they SQUEAL like a drowning mouse. It was unbelievably embarassing. The store refused to take them back, so I contacted the company directly...and ended up in a back-and-forth email exchange with an extremely rude person in customer servide who insisted I was WRONG, that the bottles didn't squeal and I was just using them incorrectly. She offered to replace the caps after I wrote back and explained that it was a WATER BOTTLE, for God's sake, "using" it wasn't exactly rocket science. BUT she'd only replace them AT MY EXPENSE, which after shipping worked out to be almost what the bottles originally cost. DO NOT BUY THESE BOTTLES! Try one of the fine products at Gaiam or  New Wave Enviro

It's kind of bulky for a diaper bag, which is why I got it.  The clippers are not good quality.  The thermometer is cheap.  It has a little "f" for fahrenheit that blinks until it is done reading.  The "f" is very little and hard to see when trying to hold a squirming 5-week old.  It also takes a while to read

Ok, I'll admit, the nail clippers rock.  I have no problem using them, they are sharp, cut evenly and are the perfect width.  That said, throw everything else out.  The bulb syringe is useless, keep the one that you get from the hospital.  Get an ear thermometer, it's a heck of a lot easier.  The spoon...not even going there.  The med dropper isn't easy enough to use.  My suggestion?  Go find a syringe with a cork attachment.  You take the top off the bottle, push the cork attachment into the opening.  To use, flip back the attached lid and put the med syringe into the opening, flip the bottle over and draw the med into the syringe.  This is the best way to do it.

This is a nice idea, but the individual components are poor in quality. The nasal aspirator doesn't get enough suction. Of course, I've never found an aspirator at the store that did work as well as the one we got from the hospital. Do yourself a favor and just ask for an extra one before you're discharged from the hospital. Second, the thermometer takes FOREVER to get a reading, and it doesn't beep or anything to let you know it's finished. The clippers are okay, but I've definitely used better ones that were just a buck or two. Never used the medicine dropper because the pharmacy gives you one for free when you get a prescription, and other baby medications (Tylenol, Motrin, PediaCare, etc) come with their own specially calibrated dispensers. The medicine spoon? Give me a break. My daughter balked at that one the one time I did try to use it

We got this for our shower. Our son is now 2 and the only thing we've used is the nail clippers. Which I actually really like the shape of them cause they are a lot easier to hold then just the tiny clippers, especially if baby starts to squirm a little. I couldn't even tell you where the rest of it is. The spoon thing and dropper for the medicine is cheap and useless. Any baby medication you buy you'll get a dropper for which works way better. The bulb didn't work well at all, just keep the one you get in the hospital, those work best! And if my little guy was sick he didnt appreciate having to sit still while I tried to take his temp. I recomend a therma scan for that. Just a quick beep in the ear and your good to go.

So basicly, I would recommend to pass on this item and just get a pair of nail clippers.

      Pure junk.  I've tried this several times.  It doesn't repair  scratches but covers the lens with a sheet of clear gunk.  The first trick is to spread the material evenly and smoothly over the surface.  And the second trick is to try to get your money back. The method of spreading it evenly is not well worked out by the product makers.

Just received two of these. Yes, how dumb of me to buy two not knowing much about it.  The quality of the casing is really poor.  The plastic is very flimsy feeling.  The labels were all half-way peeled off upon opening the box. They show signs of just simply being really old.

The instructions are written in many languages which is fine, but there are things they fail to tell you.  I also ordered the Juice AA 4 pack and 2 of the batteries arrived dead. The charger blinks red with those batteries, but the instructions do not even bother telling you what a blinking red light means.  

If you go to the juicebattery website, they do not mention this product anywhere.  Not even when you search for it. A good chance this is a fly-by discontinued product.  The company themselves have not responded to by blinking light question for 3 days now.  

As with many things, made in CHINA!

I got a few more days yet before I need to return them via Amazon's return policy which as we all know, ROCKS!

It warms ok, not great. But the worst thing is, the massage is LOUD! I work at home, in my basement, where it gets cold, and was thrilled to get this to keep my feet warm, and was excited to get massage too. However, I can't use the massage feature while I am on the phone - it is way too loud. And there is no control on the heating element, just on and off. A disappointment. I still use the heat feature, but also wear thick socks

This is my first purchase that I have been unhappy with.  The tingler arrived with two of the tingles off.  Attempts to put them back on were unsuccessful.  I had attempted to email customer service three separate times and have received no response.  I would appreciate either a refund or a new one sent to my address.

The tingler was to be part of a massage Christmas gift for my wife.  I would appreciate your time in this matter.

While the pedal exerciser mechanically works fine, the plastic or something on it smells so bad it is not pleasant to keep inside.  I have had it for several weeks now and it has not gotten better.  I called their customer hotline and was told they know about it but don't have any solutions.  I asked if they had a website I could check periodically to see if they had come up with something and was told to call back in 2-3 months.  Right.

I ordered one and had it arrive totally broken. Amazon sent a replacement. That too was defective. Save your time/money and buy another, maybe in person. I'm not convinced that hair dryers survive shipping.

(Amazon is giving me a refund including shipping, so there's not a problem there.

I also had the heater on mine go out after a few short months.  I REALLY loved this machine though!  It actually blew air!  And it has the nice SAFE switches unlike the toggles that most have now.  I had one of those previously and my cats turned it on while I was gone and almost burned the place down.  So anyway, I'm trying to contact the manufacturer, but I doubt it will do any good.  Too bad.  Loved it while it worked.  Hoped it was a fluke and was going to order another before I saw the reviews

I figured for the price, how could you go wrong? Well my fiancee used this hairdryer at most 5 times a week and in less than 3 months it has now quit working altogether. No HOT air, No Cold air...NOTHING!! This Item looks like a great deal..but Save your $$$ and buy something that will last you longer than 2-1/2 months. The manufacturer should be ashamed to sell such a product!

This is not one of the best hair dryers I've had.  At best, it's average.  The nozzle is too long, and the concentrator attachment is fixed at horizontal.  I like attachments that can rotate so that I can change the angle to reach different parts of my hair.  The ionic feature makes no difference to the length of drying time or texture of my hair.  After using this hair dryer for 1 yr and 3 mths (about 3X a week), the switch for heat settings is now loose.  The dryer only blows cool air even though I slide the switch for higher temperatures.  My rating has gone from average to below average

These glasses arrived yesterday and are the cheapest, poorly made, and most awkward glasses I have ever tried on. They are uncomfortable and look and feel as if they were purchased in the 10 cent bin at the local dollar store. Pure garbage. Don't waste your money.

[...] I can't imagine that any consumer would think of these in a positive manner.

This product is not even directionally accurate.  It said that my body fat percentage was 10% higher than actual.  Then my fit brother tried it and it said that he had 25% body fat.  Perhaps we had a lemon, but I am taking this back because it is very inaccurate.  In fact, this is the first review I have ever written because I want to warn people about this product.

I had such high hopes for this hair dryer -- well-known brand, diffuser with long "fingers" just like I prefer, etc.  Well the first time I used it my hair looked like I had been through a wind tunnel!  The low setting is like most other hair dryers' high settings, even with the diffuser on.  It really blasts the air out!  I have wavy/lightly curly hair and it made my hair a frizzy mess.  This dryer may be fine for people with straight hair, but I definitely do not recommend it for people with wavy or curly hair

I was very disappointed in this dryer and am returning it.  It is very heavy and I am not a weakling!  It is also very big.  With my arm stretched out all the way I can barely get it to my head.  Because it is so heavy and big I have 'banged' myself on the head with the 'fingers'.  Just things to consider when deciding whether to buy this dryer.

Razor blades are expensive enough as it is, and the trend of "more is better" has reached almost ludicrous points in the industry.  What's that?  Five blades, you say?  Why, it must be better than four!  Meh.

I have fine stubble which grows in at varying angles across my neck.  The good news is that, while other razors have always been unable to remove all of my stubble on the first try, this blade does, in fact, take care of the problem.  In addition to this, it aggravated the skin quite a bit (this might have as much to do with the vibrating action as with the five blades).  The precious soothing-aloe strip had little to no effect on my skin (particularly in the neck area).  If you have sensitive skin at all, this might not be the razor for you.

Contrary to the experience of others, however, the extra "trimming" blade worked well for me when getting the spots along the edge of my mouth, under my nose, and when shaping my vast hedge-like sideburns.  

However, the five blades on the other side dulled remarkably fast.  Considering my rather fine hairs, I'm used to exchanging blades once every week or so.  Now I'm exchanging them twice a week.  Seeing as how this product is already so much more expensive than competitors' products, and seeing as how it is designed to work exclusively with the Fusion razor (and vice versa), and seeing as how its lavish wealth of cutting action has clawed at my skin, I find it hard to recommend

I began using Gillette's Mach 3 razor when it first came on the market, and was very happy with it (until recently...) The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves. That was an excellent product. However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher. 

I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to "migrate" its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model. I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be. I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none. I'm lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn't cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to. 

What's the deal? Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product? That they'd rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one? If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off. I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it. So much for my customer loyalty. I'll either switch brands or stop shaving until there's another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3

I've been kinda exclusive to Remington MS3's for a few years. They've just been had inexpensively here and there so that's the main reason I've stuck it out. But in all honesty, these seem to cost me more than I've thought in the past.

Like other reviews have stated, this razor takes effort to get close. Hair does collect on the foils and thus as I've noticed, causes the blades to bind on stubble. I'm a patient person, not usually in a hurry to shave, so again not too big a deal after a quick cleaning.

But here's the weakness: the foils are like paper, and flake holes in them.

I just purchased the 2700 right before the holidays for about 25 bucks (a good deal I thought for a microscreen 3). My other 0003 was shot and running on a foil or two (once a hole developed, and I'd rashed up my neck accidentally, I removed the bad foil). I'd bought one foil pack before and gradually went through those. So I thought a new unit was the trick.

Well, now just three months later, the new 2700 has burned through two foils and is down to two (used a foil from the 0003 when the first went out). My bathroom is riddled with these things. My patience is now out and I'm headed back to an old faithful: Braun

When the internal rechargable battery dies so does the unit.
The power cord will not power the shaver once the battery can no longer hold a charge.   You cannot replace the regargable battery yourself!
Sending the unit for factory repair after its warranty will cost you more than buying a new one.
As for the shave: not bad, but not exceptional either.
The cutters a very tiny, not built to last, and are not durable.
All rechargable batteries have a limited life depening on conditions on how they are used.
This shaver may last you a few months - a year, 2 to 3 years will be a stretch.  I also have a braun and a norelco, the norelco is 10years old and running fine, the braun is 15 years - both have original cutters and foil - I heavy duty clean them in 97% alchohol about once a year, and brush out debris about once every 7 uses, these units dont have batteries and this is why I purchased the remington to have acess when there is no power plug available.
The Remington shaver really needs to have it's cutter blades cleaned (brushed off or washed) after every use (what a Pain)!
I find this shaver to be a waste of money as it is more akin to being a disposable electric shaver - than one that will last

I've been using this shaver for almost a year, and am disappointed with it.

For years, I've used the older style Remingtons shaped like a rectangular prism. I suppose this new shape is intended to fit the hand better, but I never got used to it. I find myself supporting the shaver with my other hand because I feel like I'll drop it otherwise.

The big problem is with the screen. Try very hard to avoid letting your skin come in contact with the edge of the screen. Otherwise, the blades will bite you and sometimes draw blood.

To clean, it is easy enough to remove the screen assembly, but getting it back on is tricky. If not very careful, it goes on unevenly and gets stuck. With practice, it usually works the first time.

The funniest thing about this shaver is the plug that plugs into the wall. It looks like a cutting-edge state-of-the-art plug from the 1920s

I don't know where Amazon got these cases of All Small & Mighty, Free Clear.  I use the same product all the time purchased from my local superstores and grocery stores and love it.  From my local retailers the product has no scent and is the consistency of shampoo.  The Amazon case is gelatinous and smells like latex paint.  It also disturbed me that the bottles are packaged differently than the local store version.  At the store they have a shrink wrap label and a large cap for a dripless spout.  The Amazon case has sticker labels on the same shape bottle and a small cap on a non-dripless spout.  At first I called the manufacturer.  Their customer service seemed concerned but then managed to drop my call.  So I decided to use it.  I do not notice any difference in the cleanliness level of my clothes.  

I would not purchase this again from Amazon.  The price is not that great to overcome the odd differences.  I will, however, continue to purchase this product from my local retailers

This morning I spilled coffee on my "million dollar" white dress shirt.  It left me with three large coffer stains.  I remembered that I had my Tide To Go in the car.  After drenching the stains with the solution and rubbing them per the directions, most of the coffee stains had disappeared....what remained, however, were large coffee colored rings at the edges of where the solution had spread.  So, most of the coffee stain was gone, but I'm left with the unsightly rings...not quite as noticeable, but there're still there.

These glasses were a bit of a disappointment.  The convenience was out weighed by the uncomfortable fit - they were really snug with no possibility of adjustment.  And actually they were annoying with how they hung when not in use.  Great idea but maybe some "fine tuning" would help...like a more flexible strap rather than the plastic frame just being super long to go around your neck.

This product just doesn't cut my nose hair as close as the Panasonic it replaced. If I could remember the model of the Panasonic, I would mention it in this review. I hope I can find the manual for the Panasonic so I can get another one.

Beware that many of the new designs are going this rout (even Panasonic). The manufacturers are saying this allows for more natural filtration, but I think its more of a liability issue on their part (someone probably got sued for a nicked nose). I just won't buy their products anymore if they're going to design them for marginal performance

As far as I can tell, even after following directions to the letter, I found the readings to be wildly inaccurate. For example, in the morning I got a reading of 89 over 79.  In the afternoon it was 188 over 155.  Then a bit later it was 155 over 150, nearly a flat line indicating death.  At my doctor's the reading was a very normal 118 over 78.  It's a wonder this little machine didn't cause me to keel over just from shock.  I don't recommend it to anyone. Mine is on its way back to Amazon

This unit has all marketing features, Date, Time,  Memory stores up to 48 prior readings by date & time, but there is one problem its not acurate. My Doctor said Wrist Cuffs can be -10% off just because of taking the reading at the wrist and not on the arm next to the heart, just like taking your bp on the right arm. The further from you heart the lower your readings.
Example: The doctor takes my BP then I take it with the cuff monitor  He/she sys its 110/56 54 beats/min where this one reads 151/93 60 beats/min. We tried it several times and each time it was incorrect. So he told me not to use it.  I bought a simular unit, no date, time on the screen, but stores 99 prior readings, tested again with the doctor's nurse and found it to be within limits. She said you never get the same reading twice in a row. Some nurses & doctor's even take three readings and take the average.

The seams on the pillow are sharp and uncomfortable.  The extra pouches that supposedly provide additional support don't measure up.  THe snaps that should hold the ends together don't work.  Basically, it would be OK if it came with a soft cover

I am an African American woman with long, chemically relaxed hair. As a full-time undergraduate student, I cannot afford to visit the salon on a weekly basis. I purchased this flat iron on a whim at the market because my previous flat iron had recently shorted out (it was an older model with no swivel cord). I chose this flat iron because it was the same brand as my last one, and I was overwhelmingly satisfied with its performance. I cannot say the same for this product. 

In retrospect, it does exactly what it claims to do, but nothing beyond that. With my previous flat iron, I could straighten and style my layered hair at the same time, which significantly cut the amount of heat and damage my hair had to endure. Any attempts to style my hair were underwhelming to say the least. After using the flat iron, my hair looked fizzy and unkempt, and even a bit damaged. Any curls I managed to produce looked undefined and limp. It was by chance that I purchased a curling iron in addition to the flat iron, and was able to successfully style my hair after wrapping my hair overnight and applying frizz control serum. 

Needless to say, you won't be able to produce that "fresh from the salon" look with this flat iron, which is sadly exactly what I needed. I do not feel confident about my hair when stepping out of the house after using this product. If you don't use this tool for anything but sleek, straight looks and have a bottle of frizz serum handy, then this is a great product for you. While I am not happy with its results, it will have to do for now. I'll be saving for a better iron while praying that straightening AND curling my hair doesn't leave it severely damaged.

I bought this straightener TWO times..the first time i had it for about 8 months. My friend had bought the straightener and I fell in love, so I bought my own. The first 8 months were heaven. I straightened my hair all the time. Then, at 8 months, one of the plates stopped working! For a while i used it, but it took forever, and didn't straighten my hair well at all. I decided to buy another, thinking that it was just a defect on the first. I bought the other and it didn't work nearly as well as I had remembered! In fact, it stopped heating up all together within 3 months!! Another friend of mine bought this same straightener and it caused problems for her as well. We have both decided against buying this one again, obviously, and I would reccommend you do, too. I have heard that the newest Conair straightener is wonderful, and comes with a two-year warranty, so I wouldn't have to pay again, if it did the same thing to me that this one did. DON'T BUY IT! unless, of course, you enjoy being ripped-off..

I have gone through 3 of these straighteners (i know, you think I would have learned!) however, my first one was lost, my second one stopped working in a matter of months, and the third one stop working in less than a month!! I purchased the third one (despite what happened with the second one I had bought) because it was an affordable price, I liked the size, and when the second one I had did work it worked well. Unfortunately in a matter of a few weeks one of the plates burned out so only one side works (causing obvious problems). I would recommend the sedu it has gotten great reviews and is more expensive, but I think when it comes to straighteners you get what you pay for

I've had this straightener for about 3 months - I loved it at first but now it's a love/hate relationship. The "gold" plating has started to flake off and is getting worse with each use. The effect, my hair has gold flakes that closely resemble dandriff! To make matters worse my hair snags in the corners of the plates. I gave it two stars because it does straighten my thick frizzy hair, something that is hard to do!
This is the second store brand straightener I've purchased with poor results. Save your $$$ and buy a professional model from a hairdresser - it's cheaper in the long run

It made my skin very dry and break out because of it. My floormate had the same reaction. We were both very disappointed.

I recommend going for VitaClear which i tried before this product and is less expensive than ProActiv although it is a little more expensive than this.

i bought this stuff trying to save a few bucks b/c it claims to be better than proactiv. after using proactiv for a month, then trying this stuff, acnefree doesn't compare to proactiv. granted, this is better than a bar of soap, but it's definately worth spending the extra $20 to get proactiv.

I am in my early 30's and never had a problem with acne until my mid 20's.  I had been using proactiv for quite some time (5 years or so) and it worked pretty well.  I say pretty well since it did clear my face some, but my face has not been totally clear in a long time.

Along comes AcneFree which is "better" than Proactiv since you can buy it locally and it contains more of the active ingredient--cool, I am sick of ordering it online and it is cheaper!

Well, I guess you get what you pay for--I don't consider myself to have particularly sensitive skin, but I used AcneFree one time in the morning.  So far so good--until 2 am the next morning when I broke out in hives all over my entire body.  So no more AcneFree for me, just wanted to give my experience for anyone who might be in the same situation

Woolite bags waste of money.  Plan on sewing in your own zipper, cause the one that comes on it will fail probably within the first 4 uses.. maybe the 1st.

I would give this product negative 50 stars if I could.  
I paid beaucoup for several very plain bras (no lace or other embelishments) and didn't wear or wash the bras until I received the BraBaby.  I assumed the BraBaby would protect my bras in the wash, as that's what the product claims to do. Imagine my suprise when I pulled my bras out of the washer (and out of their respective "Bra Demolition Cages") to find them RUINED.  I'm talking not wearable.   The straps of both brand new, never worn, previously mint condition bras were hanging out all over the place and looked like they had been chewed by an animal.  Both bras had dents in the molded cups.  Then I saw that one of the bras had two noticeable rips on the cup!  I nearly flipped out!  
I think my bras would've been better "washed" had I thrown them into the center of a pack of rabid fighting mad dogs.  The only positive thing to report is that Amazon refunded my money.  
Back to hand washing my bras and back to the mall I go to replace the ripped bra.  Perhaps the other with it's dented cups will be suitable for Halloween?

I found this product after seeing it lauded on The Today Show and it appeared to be a GREAT idea.  However, I had a lot of difficulty getting the back and strap porting of the bra into the BraBABY and they were pretty tangled when I later took the bras out.  I also have to wonder how a larger bra would work, considering I'm merely a B cup and it was a tight fit.  In theory, I think it's an excellent idea.  In truth, I think it still needs work.  Additionally, although the advertisement claims that you can put them in the dryer, one out of two of mine opened in the dryer both times I've used them - even drying on gentle cycle.  It did maintain the shape of the cup and the underwire throughout the wash spin cycle - a plus.  I hope they keep working on the strap and ease of insertion issue

I bought this product with great expectations that it would save my not-so-inexpensive Victoria Secret bras from excessive wear in the washing machine. It does do this, though the product is not very user friendly when your bra is fairly large cupped. I suppose if you have smaller cupped bras, this device works wonderfully. As for the larger DD or bigger cups, you have to tuck and there is a large overlap on the smaller interior ball. Also, another problem I have found is that the larger cups with underwire are REALLY hard to use with this ball. Again, due to the size of the larger cups. Otherwise, I would think that this is a great product for use with smaller cupped bras

It did what it was supposed to do, and my bras came out of the wash without any weird creases.  However, some bras hold up better in the washing machine than others, and I think the one I put into the BraBABY was one of the more durable ones.  
While it does what it's supposed to, it definitely is not easy to use.  I had difficulty putting a B-size cup in without squishing the bra.  The clasp is also badly designed.  If it breaks, it's not a big deal to tie the outer ball closed, but the whole thing is poorly engineered.  I think it was made even harder seeing as how I tried using the BraBABY with a front-closing racer back.
In the end, I think it would have been easier and just as effective to use a lingerie bag.
I don't recommend this product

It's good for its purpose but not resistant. The lock that close the ball broke in the first use when I tried to open. The other one worked fine. It's a cheap plast material, could be better and more resistant. But for now it's ok since there is no other solutions for my bras. Besides, this product is for medium and small bras. Who has large sizes will have difficult to fit the bra in the produc

I saw that there were mixed reviews for this product before I bought it, but I decided to take a chance on it anyway. Unfortunately, both balls broke their first time through the wash. My bras fell out and got squished and creased. Don't buy this!!

This is the first time in my life I have been inspired to come online and write a review of a product.

When I first saw the ad for this on TV, I thought it sounded like just what I needed.  I rushed to the store, but it wasn't even on sale yet.  Finally I found it yesterday at walgreen's- and I hate to say- it stinks!

I have just below shoulder length curly hair.  I generally throw in some gel and let it air dry- I hate spending a lot of time on my hair.  But once in a while I straighten it- which involves blow dry with a round brush, and then using a ceramic flatiron to finish.  I am not very good with a hair dryer, and it takes me a long time and I find it awkward managing the brush and the dryer, and I don't do a very good job.  Plus then I need to use the iron too, and it takes me a good 30-45 min total.

So I thought this product would be great.  All in one! A time-saver! Easier to use!

Well, I was wrong.

First of all, it took about twice as long just to dry my hair as it would with my hairdryer.  It's not very powerful.  Next, it was barely straight!  Even on the "4" setting, there wasn't much tension at all.  It left my hair puffy and frizzy and barely straight.  So after an hour, I had hair that was not as straight as if I had just dried it alone- and I still needed to use the flatiron.

Don't be fooled.  It will NOT give you the flat sleek hair that they picture on the box.

I just hope I can return it.
Guess I will stick with my CHI iron for now.

I *might* try the "long hair" version of this dryer to see if that's any better

These are just OK, not great. I have 2 pairs of the clic readers and I love them. The sunglasses, however, are not as sturdy, the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and I just cannot endorse them. I am disappointed as I am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses. It's a shame

We have three of these humidifiers, the elephant, the penguin and the cow.  Have had them for 6 months or so.  In the last two weeks, both the penguin and cow have stopped working all together and the elephant is the sole survivor.

When we got them, I thought they were amazing, quiet and did the job. Now I am deciding if I should go out and buy two more or pick another brand.

Oh and be careful, I think the steam from my sons killed his DVD player on his TV as it gets caked with the white stuff....

This Water Jet has a button on the handle just like the WaterPic. You push it to temporarily stop the flow of water. Here's a warning: it can take a lot of finger pressure to stop the flow of water especially if you have adjusted the dial for a hard flow. If you lack ordinary strength in your fingers stay away from this machine. I don't have a finger strength problem yet several times I've squirted water all over the bathroom because somehow I hadn't pushed hard enough on the stop button.

I had purchased a WaterPik, but had trouble with it leaking, and so purchased this Conair. The WaterPik is a much better quality product. The Conair seems to be very cheaply made, and I am not very happy with it. I am going back to using my WaterPik even though it occasionally springs a leak.

This device works "OK".  Jet stream is moderate.  Noise is considerable.  Has a lot of attachments that really don't do much.  I'm not sure what the brushes even do.  The dual tank function is pretty good.  But lack of pressure and too much noise outweigh the good part

This pitcher is designed so that when you try to empty it -- pour out all the water -- the filter comes crashing out! It's top-heavy. I much prefer my dispenser that lives in the fridge. It may be clumsy to refill -- which is why I thought I'd try a pitcher -- but it's extremely easy to use

The foil is abrasive and can cause razor bumps.
Also the shave is not close and will missed areas around my rear jaw line that my Remington gets fairly easily.
Overrated and overpriced eurotrash.

It was a nice looking razor but it didn't work and I had to send it back for credit. I bought another one locally and had trouble with it also. I wonder if the 5200 just doesn't have to many bells & whistles. I finally bought a 5100 it's a plain Jane but is working great

Product does not generate enough heat to provide relief to sore, aching muscles.  The "massaging" action is actually a vibration action.  When heat is switched on, the vibration action is reduced dramatically

The razor isn't bad, but the cleaning system is a joke.  Mine wouldn't release the razor & kept recleaning it.  Plus, and I am surprised that this isn't mentioned in the other reviews that I read before getting the razor, the cleaning solution (which is an expensive, printer-ink type of gimmick) stinks like metal solvent.  Bottom line is this would be a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk for a lower price

I use three razors. Last year's model of this Braun, a triple blade rotary from the leading manufacturer of rotary razors and standard double edged disposables from the major manufacturer of razors.

OK, now, let's do some math.  I get 10 great shaves from a disposable razor.  I pay, on average, 40c or so for a disposable razor.  That is about a nickel a shave including the shave cream.  At a nickel a shave, it would take 3000 shaves before I would spend $150.  Would take me over 8 years.

Now, anyone that says any electric razor shaves better than a double edged high quality blade razor (not even the expensive triple edged ones, just cheap disposables) is dreaming.  The blace does a much better job and much faster.  But, sometimes, they can irritate the skin, but electrics can too.  I can get irritated by both, sooooo, I rotate between them, and find that reduces my skin irritation problem quite well.

I bought this Braun (last year's model) after reading the positive reviews here, and later bought a rotary razor.  The basic difference is that the cheap model rotary from that major manufacturer is much quieter, shaves just as well, and cost me about 1/3 the price.

The only thing that is better in the Braun is the battery lasts longer.  It is possible also, that in some cases, it gives a slightly closer shave than the rotary, but it also tends to miss spots no matter how many times I go over them.  The Braun also has a problem with my beard when it is longer, like when I have two to three days growth.  The rotary and disposable razor breeze through that three day bush.

The cleaning machine/charger that comes with the Braun is a joke.  Yes, it cleans the razor great, but it is way oversized and you need a large space for it in your bathroom.  Even then, say you have that larger space, you can pay between $5.00 and $8.00 each for the cleaning cartridges.  I have found they last about a month before drying out.  Add $60 to your annual cost to just clean your razor.  The rotary cleans fine with a brush and the disposable razors with water.

Finally, the switch that turns on the razor is right where you hold the razor and it also locks the blade.  So I am constantly locking the blade position by accident.  Inexcusable design flaw in a razor this price.

Don't get me wrong.  This razor shaves fine.  It works best on short beards and works better than cheap razors.  But for $50 you can get a better rotary razor and for $150 you can shave for over 8 years with a disposable twin blade.  Does the price difference sound rational to you?  If it does, click "Proceed to Order"

Used it once and put it in the dogs' tub. It's really awkward to use. It sucks up your water pressure, too. Can't figure it out. I have incredible water pressure, but with this thing on, it went down to nothing. Stick to the original shower massage by Waterpik

This glove will simply temporarily mask some of the symtoms associated with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and repetitive strain injuries and make problems worse. Since one still has full function of his/her hands when using this, you are further injuring your hands by using the flexor muscles in grabing and squeezing. When using these gloves, your hands and wrist will feel better at first, but once the glove is removed your problems will persist and get progressively worse

I bought this epilator solely for upper lip hair, it takes off most of it but I dont think it epilates coz u can still see minute hair which wont be caught up in the blades and also the hair regrow in 2-3 days...much like shaving it off. I would rather goto the salon every 2 weeks than use this every 3rd day. Moreover, on underarms, it pains as much as the other epilators so if you already have one, dont waste your money on this one

OK folks, this is a relatively low quality starter kit from a really decent company.  The Art of Shaving products in general are really nice, albeit a tad pricey.  This small kit gives you a nice sample of an entire line of shaving products that work nicely together.  The full sized items will cost you about $75 - $100 total.  

The included brush is a "toss away" quality brush.  This is not just my opinion, but a quote from the manager at an Art of Shaving store.  My advice is to get some samples from a department store, then purchase the Art of Shaving shave cream (wow! a great product) here on Amazon, plus either the Tweezerman Badger Brush for $15 or a Best Badger Brush from Crabtree & Evelyn for $35.

Even though a set looked exactly like on a picture bare in mind that the box is about the size of a paperback, and it weighs about the same. All the bottles are realy tiny, they look like a one time use products, the once you receive for free with your purchase, and the brush quality is not what I expected from this company. If you are looking for a present you will feel rather embarassed to give it

It puts out a cloud of water vapor and it's not all that noisy but I had no idea I'd be spending so much time each day taking the humidifier apart, wiping it down, trying to insert my hand inside the tank to wipe that down, refilling the tank twice a day, and wondering why this humidifier doesn't have an automatic shuftoff in case I forget to turn it off. At least the filters and cleaning cartidges are easy to find. However, this is too much like an unwanted hobby so I'll be looking for another way to raise the relative humidity in my room

Maybe it's my own fault, but I didn't get that from the product description.  It's a weensy little thing for using on your desk at work or taking with you on business trips; in my apartment it barely lasts through one night.  It's also really noisy.  I am probably comparing to my last (normal sized) humidifier ( a vicks something or other, no longer available) which was great and lasted 3 years, until hard water built up too much limescale... I would have cleaned more if I'd have realized how hard it is to find one to replace it

I received this tweezer for Christmas, so I'm glad I didn't spend anything for it because it's not even worth 50 cents.  The tweezer portion does not grip on to any hairs.  It's a piece of crap as far as I'm concerned. Do not bother purchasing this product, if you do, you'll regret it

This product may be good for something but it is not good for plucking your own face. I was very disapointed in it. The tweezers were hard to push together. The light was too narrow to be helpful. The product was hard to position is a way that the magnifier could be used. I tried to use it several times and always got frustrated.

The light was very good, the magnifier (very tiny) made of plastic which was optically difficult to look thru if you already wear glasses.  But the worst part were the tweezers in themselves.  They were difficult to squeeze togeter because of their placement on the handle.  Also, I am used to sharp tweezers that come together tightly over the hair.  These did not.  So they do not tweeze well at all.  Wasn't worth all the bother of a return.  I just threw it away.  It was a good idea for a product, just poorly made.

The mirror did not work, the lights and clock did not work and I did contact the seller who told me to send it back but since the mirror had been taken out of the box and the box was totally messed up, I would have to get a new box and take it to the UPS place to send it which would have cost me about another $10 and quite frankly, it was just not worth the time nor the money

I am on my second Zadro LED Lighted Fogless Mirror - Yes, customer service was decent and they sent me a new one. However, the initial problem was repeated plus some -- it fogs up despite following directions, using their spray, and using words I shouln't repeat here. Additionally, the clock runs slow and one of the two lights is out after only a few months. One good thing is that  suction cups still hold it up as long as I press them in every week. This product has problems which make a mockery of its "ZFogless" claim. Save yourself the trouble -- don't buy it

It doesn't really smell like anything, and the heat creates dampness on what ever you put it on. But it is a good size and shape

I know everyone else has had good luck with this, but not me. The unit started running really slow after about a minute. It also seems to scrape my face. Another nit pick is that the adjustable spacer does not have any marks or numbers on it, so you don't know what setting you're on

I was anxious to use this for my mother as she has a bad back.  However, immediately after opening the product, I tried to plug it in, as it doesn't work without batteries being fully charged.  Unfortunately, this massager would plug in but did not start charging, and therefore, it could not be charged.

I will be returning this item

Two main problems with this "cordless massager". The first being that it doesn't hold a charge for very long. You may get an hour use on a full charge, and that shows diminishing power as it goes. Add to that it's general lack of any real massaging capability and you have one very poor piece of equipment. If you're looking for something to rumble a slight bit, this is for you. Otherwise, save your money

This is not my first facial sauna but it is the worst I've used.  The "Cold" function does not work well (not significantly enough at least) but the hot function works fine.  It tends to leak the water you put in, even if you keep it below the max-fill line.

This shaver is ok but has an electronic problem. I get clean shave with little bit of effort but, My main problem is with ON/OFF button. Just after using this for 3-4 months my shaver ON/OFF button stopped working.  It is always in ON position I can't switch off the razor. The only way it switches off is when the battery runs out

I was trying to make the shift from a razor blade to an electric shaver and found that this shaver did not provide the close shave I was looking for.  It also was taking me much longer to shave because I had to continually go over the same area in order for it to finally get all the hairs.  In the end, after using it for 5 weeks, I took advantage of the 60 day return policy and returned the shaver.  I am back to my razor blade.  I still hate shaving

Got the BodyBare and the Ladyfair combo.  The Ladyfair is cheap and poorly made. It pulls as much hair as it cuts, plus it cuts the skin.The BodyBare does nothing at all.  It's so weak and delicate that it won't cut anything.  Don't waste your money..

Hello,

(I trully hope you don't lose your money, because it trully hurts to buy something so expensive with high hopes).

=( trust me, this doesn't work, i sadly bought both of them Body Bare and LAdyfair. I spent over $300.00 including s/h and boy was i dissapointed.

I would like to say, that if you would like to purchase a personal trimmer or private area shaver you should think about it, i would like to tell you so that no one else is fooled by the looks or sites. I also bought everything with it! i got the entire combo and more. Since i wanted to be completely shaven without having to go through brazilian waxing pain i researched for over 2 weeks!!!!

2 weeks! none stop to make sure i bought the right product. Body bare or Ladyfair are the same. These trimmers don't do anything, sadly a normal shaver is better than this. Plus it leaves BUMPS AND RASHES!!!!

I bought the happy co electric head tripper for my husband for Christmas. He has wanted ones that we've seen in the mall, so this seem to be a good one.  Well, the plastic pieces that fit into the slot were very flemsy. We had to be careful not to snap it trying to get it in. Once we got it in, the head tripper felt great.  It really did send goosebumps down my spine.  THe only problem is the purple plastic piece broke off, litterally the next day after giving it to him. It first was bent and then finally broke all the way off. I do not recommend this product. I was thinking of getting the ting ting motorized head massager to replace them. You can still use the happy head tripper it is just one tong short

It should be noted in the description of this item that this product also doubles as a vibrator! I'm not talking about the muscle relaxing kind; I'm talking about the sexually stimulating kind. Once you remove the plastic prongs that are designed to relax the head/neck, the base is an approximately 5 inch vibrator.  Just be forewarned, customers, this item is not for the easily offended

The razor I bought came with packets of this gel, as well as the lotion.  Possibly due to the consistency, the gel gets used up more quickly. It is also not as comfortable to use as the lotion is.

The key ingredient that makes the difference is menthol.  The gel has menthol, so that's why it can be irritating.  I read a review of shaving basics online, and it says always avoid shaving with products containing menthol.  The lotion, on the other hand, always helps get a better shave, and is quite soothing

The wieght is accurate, but the body fat is way off. I had my body fat done 6 months ago by a doctor and I was 12% six months later I wiegh 5 lbs less and the scales says I'm 25%. something is off and I trust the doctor. If all you want is to see your wieght its fine, but the rest... well find another scale

I bought this scale to replace my previous scale with body fat option.  It was not easy to use, as you HAVE TO put in your information unless you want to use kilograms, and you still have to enter your height in meters.  All that aside, it continues to tell me that my body fat is between 14 and 15%.  Am I an athlete?  No.  Am I female? Yes.  Is 14% body fat possible???  Well let's just say it is HIGHLY unlikely.  I can't comment on the water numbers it gives me because I don't really have anything to go on there, but even at my fittest I was over 20% body fat, and that was a while ago..

This scale does not weigh correctly. Your results depend upon exactly where you are standing on the scale when you are weighing in. I counted 6 different results within 5 minutes the last time I used it. This is one of the least accurate scales I've ever used.

Spend the extra money to get a higher quality non-digital scale

I mostly want a bookstand that would hold a paperback book for me.  This cannot do that at all.  However, that is not just because it is meant for large books.  It can't really hold textbooks very well either.  The one that I bought ended up in a box in storage, and I doubt I'll ever use it again

I had an old Caruso molecular setter that finally conked out.  I thought the ion feature of this would be great.  The clicking is annoying, but if it worked, I wouldn't mind.  This puts out WAY less steam, causing the amount of time it takes to heat a curler much longer than the old system.  Then, after all that, it only curls about 1/2 as much.  So, it takes longer for less curl--not worth it.  I hope I can get another Caruso, but I hear they have problems now, too.  Ahhhh, remember the good old days when things worked

I was just given this set- new- and was impressed by the reviews. I'm not sure if it's just my hair, but these do little more than a roller hair brush and dryer. I figured I needed to work out the kinks and give it another try. Again same look and that's all the curl I have after 20 minutes. Concept is good- just doesn't work on my fine, full head of hair. If you want curl stick to the hot rollers.

The lotion does not get very warm and only the lotion in the uppermost part of the dispenser gets warm.  So if you want to use a lot of lotion, you have to wait in between while the lotion warms up.  I have dry skin so I put lotion all over.  Its more of an inconvenience to have to wait for each application to warm up and even when it does warm up, it isn't super warm.

This will require a large mitten in colder weather.  
This does not appear to use electrical impulse.
This will require more adapting to than you might think.
When working, it is accurate.

I bought these "professional" clippers only to discover they are very UNprofessional!  I am very disatissfied with this product and would not reccomend it to anyone.  The blades guards slip off easily and the clippers get stuck in my hair which hurts a lot.
Try looking for a better quality hair clipper

Ok I picked up a corded Vidal Sassoon hairclipper at Target. The thing was so absolutely horrible that I had to come to Amazon to vent about it. The blades seemed blunt, if not nonexistent. It would only cut little tufts of hair, and the hair had to be taut, literally held by my fingers. It literally tried to rip the hair out of my head. My follicles still hurt from the hour or so I spent trying to shave my head with this terrible clipper. Most of the hair I actually successfully removed, was due to scissors. Lubrication and blade adjustment with the screwdriver had no effect--the blades weren't *stuck*, they just *suck.*

I don't care how much money Vidal Sassoon spends trying to portray themselves as the trendy cutting edge in fashion maintenance--judging from this horrible experience, they really, really do not know how to make a decent hairclipper. I have shaved my head plenty of times over the last few decades, and I have seen some bad clippers, but never have I experienced a clipper that was so bad that it would probably be bested by a haircut given by a sharpened stone instead.

I've had these clippers for a little over a month now and they are by far the worst pair of clippers i have ever owned.  I have short hair and cut my hair myself twice a week.  The length adjuster on the side of the clippers doesn't hold.  If the clippers are positioned all the way up all it takes is a little pressure and the blade goes all the way down.  Tightening the screw didn't help either.  The attachments don't fit right, especially the blend attachment.  This attachment can only be used if you don't mind the feeling of having the hair ripped out of your head because all it does is pull.  The only good thing about these clippers is that its cordless but whats the point if the clippers suck

I've used this trimmer only twice, but my initial opinion will lead me to return it.  When trimming my moustache, it's nearly impossible to get the areas close under the nose.  

I used it to cut my sons hair, but it kept binding up and pulling his hair.  I ultimately gave up and returned to the old Oster clippers I have.  They buzzed right through with no problem.

I'll be sending this item back

This item intially fit very well but within 5 weeks I bit a hole in the right side and it came apart and I only wear it 4-6 hours a night. This product is very poor because it is expensive if you have to replace them every 6 weeks or so. I like the design and it doesn't cut up my mouth but I can't be replacing it every other month

After doing extensive research on the web, I purchased this item to replace a current blood pressure monitor. While the Easy Fit cuff was easy to place, the B/P readings obtained for my wife and myself were much higher than those obtained on our previous B/P cuff as well as higher than blood pressures taken at the doctor's office.  Since we had no confidence in the accuracy of the readings, I returned the B/P cuff to Amazon for a refund.

I had boughten this as a gift which turned out to be an aweful idea. It is way too loud and the force of air is way too strong. It literally causes loss of hearing and causes your hair to look like you were just caught in a tornado. I do not recommend this hair dryer for anyone.

I was quite pleased with this alarm clock until recently when I found that it was consistently waking me up one hour early.  I tried fiddling with the DST setting and then changing the alarm and clock times just a little but without fail it would wake me an hour earlier than I wanted.  The brightness may be a problem for some people but I found it reasonable.  Overall a good docking station, but a poor alarm clock

This is a sad invention. Instead of massaging, it vibrates and in no way "relieves stress".  Besides this, it's very low budget:  first off, the label for a "thigh massage", actually vibrates at you calves (on the ottoman).  Where it is labeled "lumbar", it actually massages your thighs.  When you try the pre-designed massages ("modes"), the chair vibrates very quickly at seemingly random spots.  The whole thing is almost musical. Whoever designed this chair should try a different profession. Besides all this, the chair itself is fairly comfortable, and the heat is nice, although a little weak

I was very excited that one of My "boys" had bought Me this chair, but when it finally arrived, I was very disppointed. the motors are semi weak, it does NOT feel like 10 motors more like 6 if that. the chair's pic is also very unrealistic in My opinion, the seating it not attached, its a pad, very cheaply made not worth the price at all... I wouldnt pay more then 80.00 for this chair!

If I could give it less than zero stars, I would.  I don't know how anyone can say this works great.  Maybe they can tell me what I'm doing wrong because I can't get this thing to work at all.  I bought it for my daughter's birthday thinking she could have some fun with temporary hair color.  She has brown hair and nothing showed up at all.  I tried everything -- dry hair, wet hair, dirty hair, clean hair -- you name it, I tried it, and we couldn't even get a remote hint of color.  The picture on the package makes it look as easy and successful as painting your hair -- total false advertising.  I kept meaning to return it but never did -- now, it will end up at a garage sale for 5 cents and a note saying "purchase at your own risk

I bought two Clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  Although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  The trouble started occurring about two months after using.  One brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  The other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged!

My experience with the customer service has been terrible.  They would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  Be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  The warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!

Don't be fooled by the similar-sounding, inarticulate reviews--this product is not what you think it is. It contains neither motor nor electrical stimulation. The "energy fields" described have nothing to do with actual energy/electricity--they might as well use the word "aura" for all of the logical sense it makes. 

In the words of a company representative:

The Tingler is not battery operated there is no button. That would be our Sqwiggler which has 2 AA batteries located in the handle.  You're welcome to return the Tingler for a Sqwiggler.  The Sqwiggler is $29.95 Please call 800-978-8765 and we can get your credit card information and charge the amount difference of $9.95 plus $8.45 for the shipping fees. 

Make your own judgement, but don't expect to be as wowed or thrilled as the company claims you'll be

This remington razor is actually too sharp if you ask me.  I used it for a period of several weeks and it caused my face to blister and it actually gave me more cuts than a 10 cent disposable razor. Ouch. However, the shave is very close - expect to use a lot of cooling lotion with this razor.  The design of the shaver mechanically is fine and appears to be fairly reliable - although its a touch hard to clean because the blades are super sharp underneath the foils. I have owned Norelco and Braun for more than 15 years and on the whole found them to be a more agreeable shave

Worked alright for a few months.  I wasn't especially pleased with the shave quality i.e. skin irritation, hair pulls.  I figured that this would go away as I was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads.  It didn't.  

The bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair wasn't easy and resulted in breakage, no doubt due to the cheap plastic used.  Never again

I once had a cheap shaver I got at Sears that I learned was made for Sears by Remington. I liked that shaver, so when I found the R-950 at Sears on sale for $40, I decided to replace my old top-selling-brand rotary shaver. Big mistake. After 8 months and having finally tired of the red and sore neck (especially with drier winter skin), not to mention the occasional cut lip I get with the R-950 while trying to shave around the mouth, I am going back to my old shaver. How can a shaver that gets close enough to hurt still give a poor shave... but it does.

It worked quite nicely until after about 9 months the display just stopped working.  Changed the batteries to no avail.  It's very pretty, but I have a less attractive old Tanita that does body fat measurements which has been working for 5 years

The scale is everything the manufacturer claims. However, with minimal use by one average sized adult, our scale lasted only about nine months. The balance part of the scale is very sound, but the battery clip that powers the electronics is poorly designed and built of very cheap components. I suspect that poor Q&A will result in a fairly high percentage of these units failing and recommend that you go elsewhere. Today, my scale will not function unless I hold the batteries by hand (not too practical when someone is standing on it...). 

Conclusions:
* Scale design is nice--looks good.
* Construction of balance components is solid, glass is very strong.  Design and construction of the power unit (battery) is rather poor.
* Scale functions as advertised for a normal sized (80kg/175lb) adult ... until the battery power clip dies.
* Buyers should avoid this scale in favor of something with more solid battery compartment and connections.

Hope this helps!

I got the machine for my fat, muscle and water analysis as well as my weight. After 1 month of use it only shows the weight.  The scale no longer works properly.  It no longer shows anything else but the weight.  It was a waste of money

I bought this straightener because I wanted a skinny straightener to get closer to the scalp. However, while it is not a horrible product, I have a 15 dollar vidal sassoon one that works much better. I would suggest either buying the really expensive ones or just sticking with one bought at the store. This isn't any better than those

Nice idea for all of us office workers, but the main backing is too soft to provide any real lumbar support. Furthermore, the movable lumbar support is made of the same soft material and is too small and not thick enough to provide any real support. I am looking for something else

I purchased the Kaz Ultra King Size Heating Pad off eBay to replace another Kaz heating pad that stopped working after 2-3 months.  Well, this is no different except I now have more expensive heating pad that is useless.  Just like the other reviewers, my controller suddenly started blinking red and would not allow me to press any other button to start the heat process.  I plugged and unplugged the unit several times with several long time increments each time.  I also tried holding down all of the hear setting buttons for several seconds, sometimes two or three at once.  Nothing worked.  Its was nice while it lasted-- heated well without getting too hot.  It is just a shame that the quality could not last for more than two months.  Thumbs down!

DO NOT PURCHASE A KAZ SOFTHEAT HEATING PAD IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEY.

I had the exact same experience as Stan, another reviewer. I bought this heating pad and when it turned itself off, I could not get it started again. Like Stan, I thought it was a fluke and bought another. Same problem, two days after buying the pad. I have looked in four stores in the Seattle area and cannot find another brand of heating pad. This one should not be on the market. I am sending both pads back to the manufacturer

I ordered two of these heating pads and paid more because it looked like they have a better cover, instead of the usual cheap cotton cloth cover that looks like a rag after being washed once ... well, they do have a different cover, but the listing on Amazon didn't say that the pads SHUT-OFF after ONE HOUR.  I am capable of turning off a heating pad by myself, and don't need/want any auto shutoff.  These two heating pads are going right back.  I can get the regular heating pads that don't have auto shutoff down at the the local discount store for half the price

I am a big fan of the regular CliC reading glasses. I own several pairs and think they are great. However, the Sport Goggles DO NOT get my vote of confidence. They have three problems which make them unusable for me: 1) on all CliC products there is an all important stem adjustment that adjusts the length of the stems to properly fit the glasses onto your head. However, unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by CliC, the Sport Googles do not adjust properly and so the Goggles run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem legnth, 2) there is also extra foam padding on the Sport Googles that make them very snug, but because of the tight stems the foam padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3)the maker doesn't make it as clear as they should in their description ... the Irridium (Red)colored lens on some of the Sports Goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking on a rocky path. Sorry Clic, but your success with the Reading Glasses went to your head ... you needed to do more user testing for comfort and vision with the Sports Goggles. I would like to return them for a larger size and lighter colored lens ... too bad for me!

I first bought the standard, and then the large size in an attempt to have a pair that fit well. I used them riding a bike in the winter months. Neither pair fit well and there are most likely very few people who will obtain a good fit. For the goggles to be snug enough to prevent wind from entering (and prevent tearing) causes great pressure above the ear. The rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely. I retired my Clics when I found foam padded sunglasses for motorcyclists.

I'm sorry that I ordered these online. I should have tried them first.
They do not fit round heads. No matter how many times you adjust them they do not fit. The bow needs to have an adjustment too. 
The magnet is not that strong when put on a round head they just pop off.
Would not buy another pair.

I purchased this humidifier, and it worked wonderfully with a soothing blue night light for my son for about a week. One night, it just stopped producing that humidifying mist and could not be coaxed into working again. I called the company, who told me to promptly cut the cord and throw it out, and they would be sending a new one to replace it (with no cost for shipping to me). I received the new one a week later, which to my disappointment, did not have the nightlight feature. I also noticed it was from a different brand company. I can't remember the name but it also began with the word "sun." So far, the new humidifier is working fine (about 2 weeks now), but it has a lower water capacity so I have to refill it every night (vs. every 2 nights with the original one) and the lack of the nightlight is a big disappointment. The process of replacing, however, was very smooth and also free so I'll give them 2 stars for that

I really enjoyed my Nano CHI iron while it lasted (RIP 7/06-11/06), it handles well, it's a great straightener, and it's a pretty color. However, I dropped it approximately two feet, onto a carpeted floor, and it stopped working. I purchased the CHI about four months ago and think that a $120 iron should be a bit more resiliant. I'll still purchase CHI products, but wouldn't recommend investing in the Nano Technology just yet...there are a few kinks that still need to be worked out, and it's not worth having to pay an extra $35 to have it repaired

I really like the size of this pitcher but there is one thing that I'm not too happy about.  The filter doesn't "lock" down into the top and when you tip the pitcher over to pour the water out, the filter plops out of the top, causing the whole top to fall out of the pitcher.  It's very aggravating and just about makes it more trouble than it's worth.  The other Brita pitcher I have, the filter locks into place and doesn't do this.

I purchased this table from another vendor--the table top was welded poorly and tilted down at such an angle when it was put together that anything you set on it would fall off.  It also does not support nearly the weight that it is listed to support.  The table bounced up and down easily if you put any pressure on the table top.  I promptly returned this table

SleepMD did not work for me and in fact kept me awake most of the night. The next day I felt horrible, partly because I got no sleep and partly because I had been ripped off for $20. I threw the pills in the trash and will never purchase any MD product again.

Sorry SleepMD - we are not impressed.  Not only did SleepMD not work for me - but my husband took it as well and was restless and up all night too.  Today we feel worse for the wear - and a bit ripped off.  No - I did not sleep through the night and wake up feeling alert and refreshed. More like we were run over during the night. I wanted to inquire to the company in person - but can't find a website to do so.  So I plan to write. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  It's a waste of money

All Sleep MD is, is Melatonin with a bunch of other herbs that do nothing mixed in. You can get Melatonin at any grocery or drug store at a fraction of the cost. Melatonin is a wonderful sleep aid, but you don't need to spend a bunch of money or take additional herbs to benefit from it! Sleep MD is a total rip off

These diapers are the most awfulest things I think I ever bought for my baby. I received a lot of the "swaddler" size for my baby shower and I tried to use them for about 3 weeks before my pediatrician pinpointed it as the source of the relentless diaper rash my son had pretty much from birth. Stopped using them and lo and behold, diaper rash gone. Fast forward 3 months later when my son was hospitalized for a week and these were the only diapers the hospital supplied. Figuring that my son was older, maybe they wouldn't do as much harm. Wrong. The rash came back with a vengeance. I had to get diapers from home for the rest of the stay. I think it's because they are lightly scented with green dye inside. Definitely stay away if your child has sensitive skin

I think the shaver works well,but the plastic is thin and cheap. The biggest complaint is that there is no carring case for the razor,cleaning brush and charger. I think the cost should of been higher if that is what it takes to provide a case

Unfortunately, my experience was completely different. Starting with the unprofessional shipping. Shaver and components were shipped in a box stuffed with old newspapers instead of professional packing material. Shaver and Trimmer are almost exactly lifesize in the screenshot on this page!! I felt mislead by the pictures. Another person said how impressive the shaver is. I had the exact opposite experience. I picked it up and I was more than underwhelmed. The shaver is about the size of a saltshaker and the battery accounts for the weight, not the motor. Not to be mean, but the shaver reminds me of something I might pickup in a 99 cents store. The other day I found a far better shaver from Remington for about $8 in my local Raley's store. Of course, to find out about this Seiko shaver first hand you'll need to open the shrink wrap which then in turns makes it almost moot to return the item, because Donner charges a 35% sanitary disposal fee if you open the item. On top of that the shipping charges are also non-refundable. On the other hand, if I return the $8 grocery store shaver to the store, I'd get a full refund, if I'm not happy with the product. Ok, so how well does it shave? Not bad, but also not any better than the $8 shaver from my grocery store. The blade component seems extremely flimsy (essentially 3 tiny blades stuck to a piece of plastic) and if you do decide to use this shaver, you'll be ordering replacement blades in no time. All in all, I was not happy with my purchase in the least. $60 spent on something that should be around $10

Upon purchasing this product, I'd hoped it would be equivilant to the product I normally purchase at the salon.  I was horribly disappointed.  It was nothing at all like the typical product, rather much more like water.  The normal scent was not present, the product made my hair greasy and my head itched all day long.  I would very much like to return this.  It's not at all the same product that is purchased at the salon.  I was sorely disappointed

I have owned the Caruso Molecular steam hairsetter for at least the last 15 years and would not buy any other hairsetting product. It is gentle on the hair and gives a wonderful, soft, steamed curl, as opposed to harsh, electric hot curlers. I recently purchased the new "smaller version", because my old one - with the larger water/heating unit, burned out after many years of use. The old one required more water and a bit of salt. It gave great steam, filling the rollers with a lot of steam, thus giving a better curl to the hair. This newer version does not require salt, uses very little water, and does not have the steam making power the older version did. I am very dissappointed in this "newly designed" product. I have packed it away, and will use it only as a back up. I hate it when you use a product for many years and find they have upgraded, improved, or discontinued the product. Sometimes, it is best to leave well enough alone. I will purchasing one of the older hairsetters on Ebay

I bought the Duro-Med 7921LCST-BG because of a back injury--I need good back support in order to sit somewhat comfortably.

This product is very disappointing.  The material with which it is filled is of such a low density that it gives practically no support at all.

If you need firm back support, I would look elsewhere (I don't know of a good source yet).    If you don't need such support, then I don't know why you'd have any interest in this product--but I suppose there could be valid reasons that I can't imagine

Though not advertised to humidify a large room, I found it incapable of making any significant difference in even a small room.  I tested it, in a roughly 1000 cubic foot room, by placing a relative humidity sensor in the middle of the room, and after 2 hours not even a 1% increase in humidity!
Fortunately, I was able to receive a full refund

I am a male.  I did a search and this item showed up for men.  However, it is way too long for a man unless he is Yao Ming.  It looked like I was wearing a skirt and came down several inches below my knees.  I am 5'10" tall.

Also the light wieght microfiber terry was a drawback.  It clings to you and builds up a lot of static electricity.  

I will not ever buy another product made of this material

design seems flawed a bit for the container. when you pull the cord out, it bumps the tank off sometimes.  the tank also seems a little loose when mounted.

I was overwhelmed by the choices, and selected this model, in part, because of the reasonal price.  I had read reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the product, but I decided there was only a small possibility of that happening.  

The instructions said to use the lowest setting initially, which certainly made sense.  However, the INSTRUCTIONS said to move the adjustment "toward the tip", which turned out to be the highest, not the lowest setting!  The diagram on the handle indicated that the movement was toward the LARGER opening, but I read the directions and did not look at the diagram until later.  The spray was very powerful and actually "hurt", especially when it was by my tooth with a crown.  

The next day I tried adjusting the settings with the pik over my sink, not in my mouth!  It felt wonderful on the lower setting!  I reread the directions again (and again over the next several days) to see if the error was mine or theirs.  I still think the directions were not written properly.  The third day I had trouble getting any spray at all.  This continued for about a week, some days getting more or less, but never a full spray ON ANY SETTING!  My guess is that it was in a permanent "pause" mode. I gave up and pursued returning the item.  It needed to be returned to an "authorized repair", which luckily was only a few miles away (there were only three in my state).  The repair man had told me, over the phone, it was a discontinued model and hadn't been made in about  a year.  When he looked at it, he found it had been made in 2006.  He said he could fix it, but wasn't allowed to; I am awaiting a replacement to arrive in the mail.

Unfortunately, the stool arrived in its box without the seat. As we needed one quickly, we purchased a similar stool locally. We returned the stool and Amazon was quick to give us a refund. The manufacturer who sent these out evidently needs some quality control

The design is great, very light, easy to handle.  It's very nice to be able to use it cordless.  However, this is the least powerful epilator I have ever used in my 14 year of personal epilation history.  (I have gone through six epilators.) It takes forever to clear a small area.

It dose good for the bikini area. However you have to hold it at a back angle for the tweezers to grab the hair properly. It did not work on legs at all. It would pull a few hairs but broke the rest. With out the guard it feels like it is scraping the skin. The tweezers area is so small it would take a week to finish a leg even if it did grab the leg hairs. Razor attachment dose not work to my satisfaction.

First, know this, it is a trimmer not a shaver!  With the included height attachment, your bound to have a little fuzz still left.  Without the attachment, you get closer results, but still very visible hair lines.  I am quite disapointed with the product, because it runs on two AAA batteries, the motor is nearly powerful enought and will lock up sometimes when cutting hair in different angles.  This lock up rips the hair out of your skin and sometimes even cuts you.  I would certainly not recommend this product, but might be necessary if you'll be traveling and need a small portable trimmer that will get more results than just letting your hair grow wild.

I have found that the MS-5700 to be very loud. The Braun 8995 that I replaced it with is very quiet. The plastic chrome on the body gives it a very cheap feel, and look, it makes it hard to hold onto. I have found that the shaver dosn't give me a very close shave compared to the Braun 8985 shaver. The solution tank for the cleaner seems to be not as user friendly as the Braun 8985 that holds a cartridge that slips in and out to replace. As you have read I have replaced the MS-5700 already with the Braun 8985, and am very happy with the change. The Braun also came with 3 cartridges for the cleaner unit, not just one bottle to pour into the cleaner.

The self cleaning concept was the reason I bought this razor. The razor cleans and lubricates automatically and the price for consumables was not bad. After owning the razor for two months I noticed that the red indicator light on the cleaning base was on after I had just refilled the fluid. After a closer inspection I found out that the fluid had leaked out all over, and this fluid destroys everything it touches that isn't metal or plastic. I thought maybe I had done something to cause the problem so I refilled the cleaning base and started the cleaning process. Immediately the fluid in the base started spewing out of the cracks where the top of the base and the bottom of the base come together. It is now headed to the landfill. The trimmer does not work well either

My Braun thermoscan has given me nothing but trouble.
Yes this ear thermometer is easy to use.  You just have to stick it into the canal correctly.  Not hard.  What I don't like is you can stick it in the same ear, the same way, 6 different times and get very different readings.
Everytime I have gone to use my thermometer, the battery would be dead.  You have to use the special medical circular batteries, so of course I would never have any handy.  Then I got smart and started stocking up on the batteries.  They are expensive.  And everytime I would use it I'd have to put in a fresh new battery.
This also needs the disposable ear covers in order for it to work.  Yes there is a trick to getting around it but then your thermometer isn't sanitary.  Finding the covers was sometimes easy and sometimes impossible.
I have just never been happy with it.  Yes it's easier than the oral... But I found one even better.  Try the Temporal Artery Thermometer.  You can use that one on a sleeping child

Don't bother with these.  I am a school nurse, and not just this brand, but MOST brands of ear thermometers are inconsistent, especially when the average person does incorrect positioning in the ear canal.  I had to use the ear type for 8 years between Pediatric ICU and school nursing.  I got pretty good at getting consistent readings, except on very small ear canals, and those with a lot of wax.  We got rid of ours and went with an Exergen TemporalScanner Temporal Artery Thermometer.  It takes less time, doesn't require probes, and you can get one at Costco for $30

The chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch, however, it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate.  
The 1 star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack.  I had intended to use it as a cold mask only.

I was excited to try these because I liked the idea of getting my son something that let him put his legs together.  I am tired of seeing him so bowlegged due to the diapers.  And since I like the other Huggies styles, I was very enthused.  Until I went through 5 diapers, everyone of which leaked.  Leaking of urine was the biggest problem but after a BM came out the legs, I gave up.  I tried everything possible to make these work, but they leak.  Maybe in the smaller sizes, but size 5 on a 22 month old definitely did NOT work.  Also, my son is in 50% percentile for height and weight, so skinny legs were not the problem.

No more Natural Fit/HugFlex for us

After many disastrous leakage experiences with their smaller-size diapers, I decided to give Huggies another try because I have a very active toddler, and these certainly did appear to be stretchy and comfortable. Unfortunately, this comfort comes at the expense of utility. My daughter was no sooner running around in the first diaper out of the pack, when I saw the entire contents of her diaper coming out the sides and up her back. Just like the smaller sizes, this version does not hold anything in!!!

The idea was great and I did enjoy the warm lotion,however I used it three times and put it back in the box. The on/off switch is located on the top of the dispenser and each and every time I turned it off lotion squirted everywhere making a huge mess and if you leave it on all the time the lotion gets hard and dries out. Would love to recommend it but I just can't. I use lotion a couple of times a day due to dry skin and thought this would be a great item for me it just didnt measure up

I quite liked this trimmer while it worked well, so I'm disappointed at how it has held up through only a little over six months.  As of now the battery will hold barely any charge, if at all.  It's frustrating to have it crap out on me after initially being pleased with its functions

After a very positive review by a popular consumer magazine, I purchased this scale. On the unit I received, the upper weight range appears to be overstated by some 20 lbs. 

The scale I was previously using and the one in my doctors office clearly have my weight below the 300 lb limit. I have been lifting weights and somewhat discouraged by the scale alone. I wanted to see if I was having an impact on body fat so I purchased this scale. 

When I attempt to use this scale, it errors out with the OL code. Perhaps the magazine should retract another article

Was initially impressed with the backrest; however, because the straps are not adjustable, it dosen't stay in place.  The one snap is not sufficient for holding the backrest in place

I recently purchased the Obus Forme Lowback Backrest, along with the Seat Cushion. Although I have heard people rave about the excellent support, and they felt comfortable enough to me, I can't give them more than 2 stars. The material used in their construction drove me to distraction. This is obviously a personal preference type of thing. Other folks may have no issues with the material at all. These are just my feelings on the matter:

I found the texture of the fabric to be a little rough and it didn't allow easy movement when sitting on/leaning against it, which would drive me crazy after just a few hours at work. Also, when making any movements, the compression of the foam, and the friction between it and the fabric covering, made really annoying noises. It reminded me somewhat of snow compressing down when walking on it. The Backrest was even worse than the Seat Cushion because it had a thin plastic wrapping (looked sort of like shrink wrap or Saran wrap) around the foam inside, which made loud crinkling noises every time I even twitched. It was awful! However good the science behind the backrest and cushion is, the sound effects and unpleasant texture were distracting enough, to me at least, to return both items.

I have a Honeywell humidifier that is on my personal top 10 "must have" items.  I figure with these cartridges the performance could only improve.  I was wrong.  There is NO improvement in the cleanliness of the tank or the filter area.  The water actually smells funny with the cartridge in.  Plus, I have noticed that the little beads inside fall out, and are reported to be harmful to pets and animals.  They're so little it's hard to see them.  Not a huge deal to me, but I'm sure it could pose a problem to someone.  

All in all, I would rather purchase purified water, or get a water filter for my sink for the water to use in the humidifier than use these, since there is no real difference.

The description for this cartridge says that it "provides continuous protection against mold and bacteria" with its "Aquastat" antimicrobial technology.  If you read the literature that comes with it, however, it says that it prevents microbe growth *in the cartridge*.  Not in your humidifier.  It's not an antimicrobial cartridge; it's a demineralization cartridge.  Whoever reported that it removes slime must be imagining it

...and it wasn't worth having to send it back.  Seriously.  I thought maybe it was the batteries, so I switched them.  No luck. It ran very, very slow, and then it just quit.  As another reviewer smelled burnt plastic when the unit was in use, it's my guess that something melted/warped in the mechanism.  I will give the manufacturer a bit of credit since this item did perform nicely the one time I was able to use it, so I'll call it a 10 dollar pedicure and call it a wash.  I have a makeup mirror from the same manufacturer and am really happy with it, so I know all their merchandise isn't shoddy.  Maybe I got a dud, considering many others' positive reviews.  I sure hope so

I went through 3 of these in less than 2 months.  After about 2-3 weeks of use, the first two dryers wouldn't shut off when the switch was placed in the "off" position; the dryers had to be unplugged to turn them off.  The 3rd dryer just stopped working completely after about 2 weeks.  I definitely do not recommend buying this product

I bought one and it worked great. At first it's hard to manuever because it's really hot, and the barrel's bristles are kinda rough and pull your hair a lot, but once you get used to it, it does a stellar job of straightening your hair. Around 6 months into using the straightner, the machine slowly overheated and died. Thinking I had a faulty model, I went out and bought a new one. Guess what ? A few months into THAT one, it ended the same way.

So basically, not worth it.

 I thought that this would be an ideal product for my aging father as both his sight and his dexterity are somewhat impaired. My first thought was to contact the parent company, Hy-Tek Manufacturing, to ask for a dealer referral and to get some answers to a few simple operations questions. After 3 days they did get back to me, recommending Amazon as a purchase source but ignoring my request for operations information. I sent a second email but it was completely ignored. Maybe this should have been a warning.

 I decided to go ahead and order one anyway. The purchasing process was quick and easy and delivery form Amazon's agent was about 5 days, more than acceptable. The unit comes well packaged with easy to follow instructions. Actual programming is simple and very straight forward. The problems started after successfully programming my dad's satellite receiver. The main menu could not be accessed, the information button was non-functional and two of the numeric keys did not work. I tried all of the codes listed for the manufacturer of that receiver, none of them made any difference.

 Another email to Hy-Tek, and another 3 day wait, produced the response " it doesn't work with all devices and I guess it just won't work with your receiver, you'll have to send it back to the supplier. We will make note of this and maybe we can add this receiver in a future update. " No help at all and no concern or consideration expressed on the part of the manufacturer. If they had bothered to respond to my original inquiry in the first place, I would never have purchased this substandard piece of equipment and wouldn't have been out the freight charges. One of the questions that I asked originally was " will it access the main menu? ", but they didn't have the common courtesy to respond.

 Be aware that this remote will not work with all devices. Even simple, necessary functions like menu and numbers may not be accessible. The manufacturer is slow to respond to customer inquiries and less than helpful if and when they do. Would I recommend or purchase this item again, absolutely not

I purchased this product in hopes of a wonderful nights sleep. Well folks this is not what happened at all. I turned on my Conair SU1W and snuggled under the covers after a very stressful day. About 5 minutes into my relaxation I almost received heart failure due its soothing sounds of a train wreck. The volume which seemed to have been controlled by Satan reached top volume, although I never had touched it myself. I tried to turn it down and the volume still was blaring. I unplugged and plugged it back in numerous times, and still it would not work

I personally have not taken this diet pill; however I am compelled to note the descriptions from folks stating that they felt "trippy" "weird" and "out of sorts". Britney Spears had been taking this stuff for a while...then as we all know she went all "postal", shaved her head, attacked photographers and just all around went out in left field and didn't return.....and we wonder why she did it...hummmm... None the less, the side effects like those reported I've seen personally from close friends. They should re-name this diet pill Asylum-X, because that's where you'll be. Diet pills like these have a negative effect on the seratonin in your spinal fluids, and I don't know about you but I'm not comfortable with something altering my state of being....just something for you to "swallow"

I bought this product after having taken Diet Fuel w/ ephedra several years ago. I needed energy this time and to lose a few extra baby pounds.  Within minutes of taking my FIRST and ONLY pill I had a horrible reaction.  I broke out in WELTS within 10 minutes all over my body. I was shaky and sick to my stomach.  I drank 5 glasses of milk to neutralize it and finally started to feel better. I thought I was going to die.  My only thought was there was no way losing weight was worth never seeing my kids again. After about 2 hours the welts disappeared but I felt horrible for the rest of the day.  Obviously there is something in it that doesn't get along with my body but after that reaction I had I have decided that no diet pill is worth the chance of what can happen to you.

And I am not just talking about weight loss products.  I took one pill....ONE PILL!  Within a few minutes, I was curled up around the toilet crying because I needed to throw up so badly but I couldn't.  I hadn't drunk anything but one glass of water with it, and yet, I was peeing all day.  I was nauseus....my fiancee stayed home with me all day to take care of me.  I didn't want to move, but I would have to go to the bathroom to pee, and would carry around a trash can with me just in case I finally could throw up.  I would not wish these symptoms on ANYONE, not even my worst enemy.  That was probably the worst sickness I have ever had

I have found another product that I want to recommend. It's called Alert and is sold by consultants like Avon, but you can also go the Starlight website and order it. It's a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without the jitters, and as a bonus I don't feel hungry when I'm using it. They also have a product specifically for weight loss. I have tried that as well. I did feel a bit jittery at first... but it settled after a week or so of taking it. I would recommend it also. I used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs. I did consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss, but I credit the supplement with giving me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings.
I'm now looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what I need ... energy and hunger control and it's less expensive than the weight loss supplement so I now use it. I've used this for years and have not had any problems.

I bought two of these pieces of junk, and believe me they do NOT work unless your room is about 3 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet. 

IT RECIRCULATES THE SAME AIR OVER AND OVER IN A TINY AREA!

When they say it cleans 700 cubic feet per hour, that is simply what the fan can MOVE per hour not what it actually will clean in a 10 foot by 10 foot by 7 foot room.


The fan is so weak at full speed you can barely feel it. Really it is sucking in air through the bottom and blowing it out at the top. Both the inlet and outlet are facing the same side so you are basically recirculating most of the same air over and over again. This thing would need to be 7 feet tall to really work well. 

In a hospital they have HUGE systems that MOVE the air past LARGER ARRAYS of bulbs.

So here you are sitting in a room with your kids coughing on one side and this thing recirculating the same air over and over again, in a little tiny airspace, what a great deal. Just be ready to buy 10 of them per room.

Maybe you can try hanging 5 on the celiing and putting 5 on the floor of a  4' x5' bathroom and it might work in a week.

Do yourself a favor, and buy a machine that has more UV light bulbs, and has a greater airflow so ALL the air in a room is moving and ALL of the air in the room goes through the filter.


I gave it a one because it looks nifty.

After hearing about this product and reading the reviews, decided to get one for our newborn baby.  The problem however, is that this does not cover the entire room even on its "high" setting.  Over the course of an hour, I would say this thing covers only a sixth of the air in our room (12 x 12).  I put my hand in front of the sanitizer and could barely feel any airflow and this was on the high setting.  I've only had this product for a month so I will have to follow-up on durability.  

First month impression is this thing is too weak to adequately sanitize an entire room.  If it were a bit stronger, would give a better rating.  I feel like I will return this item and get a stronger air cleaner, or buy 3 of these (not practical)

You were kind enough to replace my first order of these razors due to the fact that one never worked and the other wore out quickly.  The second pair seems to be pretty much the same.  One sputs and spurts and the other works only when I shake and tap it several times.  I used to own another brand of these razors that were great, but I can't recall the name, unfortunately.  I am very disappointed in the product, but I'm very satisfied with Amazon and the way in which they are trying to please me every way they can

I expected so much and yet recieved so little from these so called &quot;batteries.&quot;  Number one, I was disappointed to find out, after some scientific analyses I performed on them, that duracell's world famous  &quot;copper top&quot; statement is erroneous. This so called &quot;copper  top&quot; is nothing more than a copper-aluminum alloy called  copposyclamatrane. I can't top the copper top? hardly.     After the  analyses, I put these &quot;copper top&quot; batteries to the test.  What I  did was I stuck them in my flashlight expecting a brilliant flashlike-like  sheen.  What I got was far from.  A tiny light that could only be  classified as much less than miniscule.  I threw the flashlight at my cat  in disgust, expecting hilarious results, and I wasn't disapointed!  This  was the only good thing that came out of the worst purchase decision I've  ever made.  Thanks for nothing, dura-hell

Although I am definitely on the 'Sonicare' bandwagon in so far as this product's ability to clean my teeth--it does a great job--this model brush is made quite poorly. 

The battery compartment (the e3000 uses 'AA' batteries) on mine, regardless of it having an o-ring on the door, seems to be continually wet inside, with the negative (-) terminal on one of the AA-cells rusting after only two weeks use. Philips acknowledges this is a problem but offers no solution.

Also, there are many small crevices in/around the nameplate on the side, and a large gap under the nut for the brush-head that accumulates 'gook' on a daily basis. Philips advises that this is probably 'mold' and the brush should be 'disassembled and air-dried' after every use. It takes longer to do this than to brush my teeth--

Again, while this is probably one of the best ways to clean your teeth at this point in time, and an economical way to try one of the products that normally start out at $64e (and up), there is no reason why the e3000 shouldn't be made as well as the better units, or hold up to water/daily use as well as some of the $9 Crest electrics we commonly see

The best kind of electric toothbrush (according to my hygienist) is one with a rotating top to the head, that way it gets the gums better. I ordered this one and I don't like it... besides the lack of rotating head, it is very loud and I feel like I'm going to wake up my roommates. :)

I had an old Sonicare (rechargable) for about a year and a half. I dropped it and it stopped working. (My fault.) Not willing to pay ~$[...] for another rechargable one, I thought I would give the e3000 a try. 

I then bought my first e3000 in August for 2006. It mysteriously stopped working around December of 2006. (I didn't drop it this time.) I bought a second one. It also mysteriously stopped working in March of 2007. (Again, I didn't drop it or harm the toothbrush in any way!) 2 Dead Toothbrushes in 8 months! 

I'm not sure if I should buy another e3000 or if I should give up on the Sonicare brand completely.

The good:  the massage function works fine, no problems with the performance, and the battery holds a good charge.

The bad:  how much money is saved in construction by using the 
cheapest foam padding imaginable? 

The ugly: the 'pebbled vinyl' material on the arms is already separating after six months.  Maybe a cheaper material could have been found...but I doubt it.

Overall good in theory, but very poor in execution.  If some real quality were put into the product, it would rate potentially 5 stars.  'Til then,you've been warned....

I've had my shaveer for about a week and have given it several opportunities to do well.  I've worn out 3 Norelco shavers so this was a confident purchase I thought.  This razor grabs chunks of flesh and heaves it around the room as if the objective is to destroy my face rather than shave it.  I have tried to exercise the utmost care to keep this thing from ripping my face apart, but it continues to do it at least 4 times each shave, and with nothing more happening than just moving to another place on the face.  I'm going to decide who my worst enemy is and present it to them as a gift

I bought this product based on the great reviews on amazon.  I had one of the original epiladies from the eighties, and was expecting some kind of miraculous new design that would be pain-free and effective.  Well, I guess you can't have both.  It's very comfortable to use but completely ineffective.  It takes forever to clear each section of hair, and the hair that is taken off breaks off just above the surface.  So the result is skin as stubbly as a three day old shaving job.  I guess it's back to the good old razor for me

This grinder was recommended to me, but I have to say I find it frustrating to use.  Juice leaks out the bottom when grinding steamed vegetables or juicy fruit, and grinding some things (e.g., green beans) takes a lot of force.  While the price is fine, the high cost of "shipping and handling" to purchase one unit made me angry; had I noticed before I bought it, I wouldn't have!  Since then I've noticed that this is sold at most local grocery stores

I purchased this item because of the trustworthy name and cordless feature. The positive reviews here are from first impressions. However, I have had this clipper close to a year but with probably less then 5 hours use. When I first received it, it felt very light and cheaply made. I gave it the benifit of the doubt and hoped for the best. Last time it worked, the motor slowed down to almost a halt. I keep it cleaned and oiled. The motor is just too cheap. Im not sure what the company Wahl was thinking when they made this product. They should really consider discontinueing this model because it is hurting their image. I would not even attempt to use my warranty because it's not defected parts. It's a total LEMON. It would be nice if they will let me exchange it for a different model or full refund. I would even pay the difference.
I do not recommend this product

I bought these clippers for cutting hair at home. Even when fully charged they offer very little power and tend to bog down when clipping only mildly thick hair. The charge doesn't last through one haircut.

The trimmer blades come off when you try to advance them with the thumb slider to adjust the length of hair being cut, and they don't trim evenly. I finally gave up on the trimmer attachment and went with just the trimmer blade over a comb.

I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I was extremely disappointed in it

The adjustable slider combs are horrible and I found the Conair where you had several combs to choose from worked better for me.  I cannot get it to cut the hair on my husband who likes it very short, it would not even take any hair off.  All it did was waste money and electricity to charge the battery.  I thought this was the best brand out there, but Conair beats them by a mile. I think I will take it back and get a refund and go buy a Conair with the money.

We recently bought the same model dispenser, but in the satin finish.  From the first, only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps didn't work (yes, we followed the instructions carefully).  Two months later, another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable.  Instead of this loser, try "The Dispenser 71450 Classic IV." We had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age. It's harder to fill than the AVIVA and not as pretty, but so what -- it works, and the AVIVA doesn't.

I got this curler set, and I completely regret it! I used it once, and I wont touch it again! It left my hair frizzy, and there was a bump from where the clamps were. It took me 3x as long to get fix my hair as it did to put it in the curlers and wait for it to cool down. I wouldn't even give it one star...take my advice- DO NOT buy this!

I bought this for my lower back. I am pregnant now and my back keeps getting achy and goes out from time to time. It is great because it actually wraps all the way around to the back of my hips giving my entire lower back the heat without having to switch it from one side to the other. 

However, the inner pad bunches up tremendously. I have used it for a few weeks now, and have to take the cover off to "open" the pad back up by stretching it out again. It hasn't gone back to the original shape. If I had known it would do this, I would have never purchased it.

I wish I'd listened to the other reviews.  I bought this and it heated for exactly two months and then quit on me.  Claims a five year warranty but I can't return it to Amazon so it's just money wasted.

Be smarter than me, avoid this product if you value your money

This heating pad was received as a gift to replace the Sunbeam heating pad I had used for 35 years and had finally worn out. I was delighted with the larger size, but the new pad did not heat at all. I returned it to HoMedics (along with the $5 handling charge), and two months later they sent a replacement. The replacement heats up, but after one use the pad was hopelessly twisted. It almost looks like it has melted to itself, and it can't be flattened out. I won't be sending this one back with another $5 handling charge--it isn't worth it. This one goes out with the trash, and I go back to Sunbeam.

I liked this heating pad so much when I first used it that I immediately ordered a second one (for what I expected would be a year or two in the future). What I liked was that the wiring was indeed much thinner than other pads, allowing it to conform to the shape of my body. However, the first pad lasted only two weeks before failing to heat. I returned it to HomeMedics and they ignored me. The second one lasted nearly a month before it to failed to heat. I will not bother wasting the postage to return this one, as obviously HomeMedics does not care about quality nor customer satisfaction. I recommend that you not waste your money on this defective product

I bought two boxes of these Luv diapers (thats 448 diapers!) and I sure wish I had spent a little extra for Pampers Swaddlers.  These diapers leak out the top because they don't have any elastic on the tabs or anywhere on the waist.  Even the generic Kroger diapers have elastic waistbands!  I am just sad that I have to use these crappy diapers for so long! I also think they run small so I probably will not even use them all. What a waste!  The only good thing about these diapers is the price, but, I would highly recommend that you just buy your store brand instead if money is an issue.  P.S. I don't like Huggies either because they leak out the legs! Hard to find a good diaper

I purchsed a package of these because the supermarket was out of my regular diapers and my baby is only two months and we've been trying different diapers. I was instantly disgusted by the scent when I opened the package; the diapers are scented and it doesn't say so on the package. I would never have bought them if I'd known that. 
The worked fine for leaks and those related worries, but every time I put one on her I was irritated. I want to smell my baby, pooh incidend or not, when I pick her up. I don't want to smell the flowery perfume a corporation has added to their diapers. Shes my child, she smells, its ok

The plastic on the foot massager was cracked down the center with a thin crack branching off to the right spinner. I was not in the same state when the package arrived so I was not able to open it for over a month...my loss. I don't know if it was not structurally sound, or if the box was just not handled properly.  Either way, I've got a dud

I'd give this machine 5 stars if #1)it wasn't so expensive and #2), it wasn't so darn small.  It barely fits anything inside.  It works well for pacifiers and a rattle or two, but that's about it.  Anything else just won't fit.  And the design of the inside, with the piece in the middle, makes it even more restricting.  In my personal opinion, this product is not worth the money.  I am so disappointed, because it sounded so perfect.  But, its just not

Just used this razor for the first time.  Could not get a close shave out of it at all.  The trimmer will cut hair but not stubble.  On top of all of this it gave me a pretty bad gash.  I'm very disappointed in this razor but I guess I got what I paid for.  I'm going to order a new razor right now because I can't stand to shave with this one any longer than necessary

I was happy to see this type of product available, but was not happy when I received it.  It seems like a flimsy piece of plastic, and the "magnets" looked like they were painted on, a gold-tone, and the paint looked like it was chipping off.  The base of the item is separate from the top of the item, which seems to be attached with springs?  It did run, but was very loud, like it was working too hard.  There is a note not to use it more than 20 minutes, which I'm not sure is because of a potential adverse affect with the user, or because the unit might overheat.  There were some spelling errors on the outside of the box (a few places said "reflexology" and a few places said "relexology")-- but maybe that just bothers me?  I think it is also important to note that the buyer pays shipping, and if returned -- also pays RETURN shipping charges; and when combined, nearly equals the original cost of the item.  ;o(

I have cracked heals and a bit of a callous problem.  They aren't dragon feet, but they do have to be softened pretty often.  I have used the little blade scraper tool for a few years and that works well but when I saw the Artemis Heel Smoother advertised, I decided I had to try it.  It's a waste of money.  The appliance is no more than a low-tech dreml.  In fact, I have a Dreml type tool that was marketed as a dog nail trimmer that works better.  The Artemis appliance does NOT scrape any dried skin away..it merely sands your foot a bit..that is when you can get the darn thing to stay on the spot you put it on.  It comes with a small container of foot conditioning balm that is probably just straight cocoa butter except it has a really offensive aroma.  I would just as soon use a piece of sand paper than this thing.  Save your money.

I bought this after I read the first review below (the one who gave this 5 stars).  It just doesn't work very well...I do a better job pumicing on my own (it just takes more effort).  The motor does get extremely hot, and the batteries die very quickly.  The box says it can run for 45 minutes on two AA's, but after about 5 minutes...you can feel it slow down.  

Definitely not worth it.  I'm calling today to return it.

I really wanted to like this product after reading all their hype about how quick and easy it is. Not. The motor in it heats up quickly and the thing stops working. You wait about 20 minutes for it to cool down and it will start up again. But by the time you are  getting results in one area of your foot, the thing heats up and stops working again. I went through four intervals of effective operation, heat build-up causing it to quit, waiting a long time for it cool off before starting up again. Finally I decided it isn't worth the time and aggravation, even though it produced good results during the intermittent periods when it worked. One more thing -- when I gave up and decided to return it, I took my Duracell batteries out and they were blazingly hot. I worry that it might be possible for the batteries to explode from the hot-running motor. I've never seen batteries get scalding hot like this.
UPDATE: Found Something Much Better
After returninng the Artemis, I tried the Medicool PediSenso professional pedicure appliance. This one costs 5 times the price of the Artemis but is SOOOO much better it is well worth it. The Medicool is plug-in electric and has much more power than the battery operated Artemis. It has variable speeds, 5 different sapphire filing attachments, and enough power to operate as long as you need. The sapphire files are different shapes and sizes and should last a lifetime, whereas the Artemis requires repeated purchases of its disposable filing heads and batteries. So over time the costs of owning the Artemis will add up -- if the overly hot motor does not burn out. If you have serious callouses and corns, like I do, the Medicool PediSenso will do a very serious, rewarding job. I'm so glad I found it and I am grateful for the relief it provides

I tried this product because I had been using Arthred-G powder which was discontinued.  This product did not mix well either when stirred or shaken and the taste is so offensive that I could not finish drinking it.
It tasted and smelled rather like soap.
If you used Arthred-G you know it was easily mixed and did not effect the taste of the beverage.  There is no comparison here!!!  I would totally avoid this product

I like how quickly the rollers heat - a vast improvement over waiting at least half an hour.  However, like the other reviewer said - I absolutely hate the clips.  They are all one size, so they are too large for the smallest rollers.  I also don't like them because they don't keep the roller still like the "U" shaped clips did, and they leave a dent impression in my hair.  I don't recommend them primarily because of the clip system

I've tried this razor for 5 weeks, both wet and dry and can only say that this is the worst electric razor that I've ever used. It doesn't give a close shave and requires a second shave with a standard razor to remove some of the stubble. I should
have bought a new Norelco instead of this. My old Norelco always
shaved me close. This Panasonic would still be handy as a travel razor, or to be used in a pinch. But for a close shaving everyday razor, this isn't the one to buy. 
Oh well, I waited too long to send it back

The previous reviews about this product were absolutely correct. The description of this product is a misnomer. The heating pad never heats up, and takes forever to just  warm up. On a scale of 1 to 5, I would rate it a zero! Don't waste your money on this. I will be returning mine

I bought this one because it had 4 settings instead of three - So I thought one of them might actually be hot.  Instead, the highest setting is warm to the touch - not hot.  This may be a "lawsuit friendly" reality with heating pads today - I've yet to find one as good as my old one that died 2 years ago (I had that one for 10+ years, the Sunbeam replacement I bought prior to this one lasted 2 and wasn't hot).

I couldn't send this item back quickly enough.  I presumed by its price being 2 to 3 times that of other foot massagers, that it would be an effective, high quality item. NEVER PRESUME!  

With a low powered hair dryer mounted in the middle, it sounds like a small aircract while the base vibrates uncontrolably.  I'd say about twice as much energy was disbursed out the feet of the unit to my hardwood floor than to my feet.  

I'm not someone with unreasonable expectactions as many of the reviewers I've read seem to have.  This is just an unusable product.  The materials look cheaper in person, it offers virtually no "massage" to the foot, and it is incredibly loud.  There is no redeeming quality to this item.  

Before I bought it, I looked all over the web for a review, unable to find one.  Hopefully I can save someone else the disappointment.  Did I mention I hated it

I've had this for about a month, and I've used it less than 6 times.
Even though I've carefully handwashed it, and merely wiped off the ice ring, the ice ring has sprung a leak (ewww, blue liquid on my celery!!).
The lid is difficult to snap on/remove.
The center container/lid is really too tall for its diameter, which makes using it for dipping rather awkward

Though the description of this product says it's filled with natural buckwheat hulls and rice, mine had a strong smelling deodorant coming from the removable bags you heat. I used them once and then packed them away because I do not like the odor. I wish the mitts had been unscented. Perhaps over time, or by next winter, the odor will be gone and I'll get some use out of them

I just purchased a new heating pad to replace the one I had for years. I read the reviews and could not decide between all the choices, price being the primary concern. The saying you get what you paid for is true !! The heating pad works ok but the outer edges of this pad scratch you and the covering cloth is very cheap. Pay more and be happier

I had bought this heating pad previously for an elderly cat because it did not have automatic shut-off and it works wonderfully. I just bought another one for our sickly kitten and they have added an automatic shut-off valve that they do not mention in the product description! I wanted a heating pad without automatic shut-off! I can get a heating pad with an automatic shut-off anywhere

I bought two of these based on a 2005 customer review saying they don't have automatic shutoff, but now they do.  I guess this is considered an improvement, but I bought them for an elderly cat, and she can't reset the control every hour.  They are a good value if you don't mind the auto shutoff

Before you buy, be sure to check where the pen was made. I have a number of older Cross pens that say "USA" near the top, and they are great pens. However, I have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made, and they are of inferior quality. The top and bottom halves are loose, and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap. The first one I got, I sent it back to Cross for warranty repair under their "lifetime guarantee," only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a "handling fee" attached.

I was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly, one bad pen. So later on when some new colors came out, I bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect.

My advice: if you want a good Cross pen, go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in USA. They aren't making them the same anymore.

This pad barely got warm. It's going back! Since this is the same complaint as with another Sunbeam model I tried, I suspect it isn't defective but intentional... probably for legal reasons. But shouldn't a heating pad actually have some heat to it??

This thing is a cheap piece of plastic, and for the same price you can get the larger, nice rock fountain that i have owned and know for a fact works well. I can hardly hear the sound of the rain over the whirring of the motor. It has a nice design in terms of look and it's compact. I also enjoy the lights for ambiance. But for relaxation, this thing has brought me more grief in 3 days than it's worth

These 'cartridges' sell for about $2 a piece, plus shipping. I recently switched from the Mach 3 Turbo to a Merkur Double Edge Safety Razor and I can safely say I will never go back. The Mach 3 provides a decent enough shave (much better than an electric, in my experience) but the single blade is actually much smoother. I pay about 50 cents a blade now with the safety razor - each blade lasts a little over a week - versus the Mach 3 at $1.50-$2.00 lasting 6 or 7 days

The shave gel bars that are attached to this razor extend out past the razor making a close shave nearly impossible. This razor worked ok on my legs where an extreme smoothe surface is not necesssary. But using this on the the more intimate areas is just frustrating because the gel bars did not allow the razor to get close enough to the skin. This razor does not poduce a light lather, it is more like a slime that drips from it. I did not notice a tropical scent

Oh Fusion Razor, Fusion Razor,
Gleaming long and bright.
Bring to the growth upon my face
Your buzzing, five-blade might!

Your contours sleek and overformed,
Your gripping action steady.
Your shaving power manifold,
T'would make a weak mind heady.

What thoughtfulness lies 'neath your shine?
You gleam like spaceship rubble!
And with your "Future Now" design,
You lay waste to my stubble!

Too bad you lay waste also to
The skin beneath the hair.
Now I bemoan the scabby strokes
That mar my visage fair.

Purring like a happy tiger
That stalks its helpless prey,
With your five and shining claws,
My face you swiftly flay.

Our first few dates were sweet as silk,
Your touch was oh-so-gentle.
But by date three you bit and chewed,
You've proven tempermental.

Oh, Fusion Razor, Fusion Razor,
Why have you done me wrong?
Although you're mighty, it's too bad
My skin is not as strong.

Why do I keep on giving you
A chance to find redemption?
What razor god hath granted thee
Such epiderm exemption?

Oh, no more, no, my razor friend,
Your doom is clearly written
By tributaries crimson red
That on my cheeks you've smitten.

I wondered when I purchased you,
Just what the "fusion" meant.
Now I think it marks the meld
'Twixt shaves and punishment.

"The leading edge of science!"
"The future is today!"
"The greatest shave technology!"
Your advertisements say.

Technology's not always good.
Although it's what life's built on,
It also causes wars and monsters
(much like Paris Hilton).

I need no buzzing, layered mesh
Of steel that swiftly flails.
I think I'd rather shave myself
With dull Lee Press-on-Nails.

So, adieu, my Fusion Razor,
Don't leave in dour depression.
Take comfort in that tho' your banned,
You still left an impression

I got the Fusion razor in the mail a few weeks ago so I decided to give it a try.  At first it seemed ok, but I started noticing that it pulled at the hair on my face more than my Mach 3 turbo.  I decided to experiment and shave half of my face with a Mach 3 Turbo and the other half with the Fusion.  From my experience, the Mach 3 Turbo gave a closer shave, and glided much smoother across my skin than the Fusion.  I think the 5 blades on the Fusion are more of a gimmick than anything else.  And as cool as the single trimming blade is, it seems like Gillette had to include this because of the poor accuracy of having 5 blades.  In other words, the single blade is a fix rather than a feature.  My call is if your using a Mach 3 Turbo, don't waste your money on the Fusion

Gillette has a quality control problem with the blades.  This is a recent problem, but it nonetheless has caused me to swithch to Schick disposable razors.  The Gillette problem has to do with the blue strip on the razor face.  The blue strip degrades after only a few shaves, and then it actually leaves a blue residue on your face.

I recently purchased this model to replace an older Panasonic model that I loved for years. This new model ER430K is simply horrible and is a completely unacceptable replacement. It's nice and quiet, and I'm sure the vacuum works great, but I wouldn't know since the blades would not cut the hairs I was trying to trim. We're talking about hairs easily 1/4" in length. A trimmer should be able to shave those down, don't you think? If the hair was longer than that I could have used scissors. Don't bother even trying this product, it's a waste of money

My rollers are constantly popping out of the clip holders from this set, regardless of me using more or less hair. Maybe there is a magical perfect portion of hair to roller ratio. If so it is impossible to find. I dunno, but I do know I would NOT recommend these. Also even when I get these to stay in my hair, my hair doesn't curl nearly as much as it usually does in hot rollers. Overall buy something else

I have very thick, very coarse, wavy hair. When my two year old CHI straightening iron broke, I needed to replace it quickly!  Locally the only iron I could find was the T3 Tourmaline iron, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It cost more than the CHI, was sold at a fancy salon, and could even be used on damp hair.  Surely it would be a good replacement.

Unfortunately, it failed to impress. 

-It did not leave my hair silky smooth.  While my hair was certainly straighter, it still looked coarse.  (This was on the hottest setting and with several passes over the hair)

-Because my hair is so thick, an iron needs to reduce the volume.  The T3 failed in this respect, too.  

-I thought I would like the larger (almost 2") iron surface.  The T3 has a perfectly flat surface, which made it impossible to get a flip or curl on the ends. 

Needless to say, I returned it quickly to the pricey salon and will be getting another CHI!  Perhaps this brand would work better for someone with fine hair, since the temperature can be adjusted

Do not buy this iron.  It's fabulous while it works, for which it does merit the one star.  But it broke in less than a week.  It overheated, or something, and then wouldn't turn on again.  But here's the kicker: if you buy it from Amazon, the company won't honor the warranty.  

I don't have particularly heavy-duty hair.  This is just totally unacceptable.

However, after using for 10 minutes it automatically shuts off and would not come back on. Straightened and dried my hair beautiful but spend the extra money at Sephora because everyone is getting bad irons from Amazon. It is really sad that no one can get one that is worth what you pay. So if you have had good luck with one so far, be glad because I paid for the 2 day shipping couldn't wait, and have GREAT disappointment because now I have to return it!

The concept is cute, although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them, but the main problem is that they give you hat hair, compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head.  Regular glasses go in between the hairs, so everything fluffs out.

If you never take off your reading glasses, have a buzz cut, are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head (but be careful of buns), the clic connect reader may be fine for you.  Otherwise, conventional glasses are a better bet

The ice ring used to keep the salad cold burst the first time I put it in the freezer!  Evidently, the plastic did not allow for adequate expansion when the gel froze, so the seam burst and the liquid dripped out when it thawed!

I had another Norelco shaver for the last 5 (or more) years.  The difference in the shaves is striking.  Both less pain when my stubble is a little long and closer.

However, the reason this shaver is cheaper is that there is 1 battery inside it instead of 2.  I know this because I took it in to be "repaired" because I only got 8 shaves to a charge.  I talked (online) with Norelco and they said my shaver was broken.  So, I looked up on the Norelco site a local authorized repair shop.  I took it in and the guy opened it up.  He said it was one of the "cheap" versions that has 1 instead of 2 batteries.

My old shaver, over most of its life, gave me 25 or so shaves before needing to be recharged.  That's quite a difference

I really wanted to love this fragrance...after all, it is quite expensive and I'd read rave reviews on many websites...but after one spritz I sold it to a friend of mine! My favorite perfumes are Beyond Paradise, Ralph Lauren Romance, Ralph Lauren Style, and DKNY Be Delicious. Light Blue, to me, smells overwhelmingly of musk. I wore it all day and I ended up feeling nauseous, with a bad headache. This must be one of those perfumes that works well on most everyone else except for me

I've been taking these for over 3 weeks.. I have not seen any new hair growth.  I think that new hair that does grow will be stronger but this has not caused my hair to grow any faster.  I would suggest just buying hair supplement vitamins from GNC or any other place you can find them.  They are much less expensive

These hair topia pills are nothing but garbage! Pure nonsense! Trust me, I know this because I used to buy them. I first bought these pills last year in June 2005 after hair formula 37's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage. Well, these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned, and had promised also to change dry and brittle hair to long and healthy, and it did absolute NOTHING. I said to myself, like hair formula 37, that maybe I just need to give this more time, so I bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all. This product might just work for others, which it has, but it certainly didn't work for me. I must admit that I brought this on myself, as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway, and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like Giant or even hair vitamins in the damn Dollar Store! These hair growth pills are too damn expensive, so when you are paying all of that money then you expect it to work. The fact that it does not is infuriating because $39.99 + $7 in shipping, with a total of a little over $46, is a lot of money to spend on something that does nothing. Thus, I am here to warn others not to waste their precious money. And if you are going to, please don't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com.

Sure it has many pretty lights and a slick design. One problem though: it is terrible at SHAVING! I was using my old Braun 6520, and was quite happy with it. Then I saw a good deal for this "new, redesigned, superb, self-cleaning" shaver and decided to upgrade. Bad idea! After shaving with it, it looks like I have a day-old stubble. No matter how much I twist and press it, the "new super system of blades designed by no one other than Gillette" does a bad job.  This morning I actually pulled my old 6520 out, shaved off as much as I could with this "360 Complete" garbage, and then used 6520 to see how much "clean up" it would do. The difference was both very visible and substantial! I am really sorry I bought this and feel duped by their marketing... Don't make the same mistake as me. Buy something else and save your money

I got this as a gift for my husband.  He used it for about 3 weeks, but still had red marks, and had to follow up afterwards with a regular "disposable" razor.  The whole process of shaving took twice as long as disposable razors and wasn't as good.

Luckily, Braun had a 30 day money-back guarantee, so we were able to return it (minus shipping x 2)

i had ordered this item expecting good things from it. however, the article has never worked properly. the electrical system seems to be working fine, but the uv light has never come on. somehow it seems pointless to have a toothbrush sanitizer that does not sanitize. right now the product is only a toothbrush holder; nothing more. i generally do not pay such a high price for a toothbrush holder. i have been in contact with the producer of the product and hope to have something done about it. in short, i won't buy anything like this again

This product states 4 toothbrushes.  That is incorrect, it only holds 3.
This product also states 4 AA batteries or AC Adapter.  That is also incorrect.  You cannot use 4 AA.

I felt that was misleading and unfortunately unless to me.

If those things don't bother you, it might be what you are looking for, but since it does bother me, i never even tried it

I agree with other reviewers that it feels good and doesn't smell too much, however, I've experimented with it several times to confirm my findings, and it turns out to give me really bad blackheads.  I'm 25 with an oily t-zone and very dry facial skin. On mornings after using this cream, I have nasty blackheads on my forehead and chin. 

There are better products out there

This may work well, but the cuff size is not as it is in the description. It says this will work on an arm circumference of up to 18 inches. Not even close. My arm is a little under 13 inches and was too large for the cuff by far. Sure, you can get the cuff to go around your arm, but there are indications on the cuff that have to line up for it to work properly, and there was just no way to even come close

Before you buy, be sure to check where the pen was made. I have a number of older Cross pens that say "USA" near the top, and they are great pens. However, I have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made, and they are of inferior quality. The top and bottom halves are loose, and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap. The first one I got, I sent it back to Cross for warranty repair under their "lifetime guarantee," only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a "handling fee" attached.

I was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly, one bad pen. So later on when some new colors came out, I bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect.

My advice: if you want a good Cross pen, go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in USA. They aren't making them the same anymore.

I have been using Cross product for lat 15 years. This product which is Made in China, has highly disappointed me. The finish of the pen is very poor. Gold plating is  of a poor quality. It has some patches of a different color. The body has sharp edges.
Overall it has spoilt my impression about Cross products.

I don't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose. I don't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all; as I said I don't have a huge melon like Mike Myers's brother in "So I Married an Axe Murderer". The idea/concept is great but...I'll probably return them. Unfortunate because I was really looking forward to using them. People with REALLY big heads, caveat emptor

I was surprised to find positive reviews for this heating pad, since I just returned mine after one use.  Perhaps the one I got was defective, but even on the highest setting this heating pad was barely warm to the touch and wasn't hot enough to penetrate my sore back muscle.  

I also thought that the convenience of strapping the pad on would be excellent to target the lower back area, and found the shape of the pad and the flimsy elastic strap provided to be very uncomfortable to wear.  The placement of the strap doesn't allow the pad to conform to the body, but only to press against it where the strap runs through - just the center, not the rest of the pad.

I realize there are probably now safety standards for heating pads that preclude them from getting too warm, but hopefully they are not so stringent as to not allow any electric heating device from getting warm enough to penetrate sore muscles properly.  

For the time being I'll keep wearing Thermacare(TM)  back wraps (which are expensive - could have bought two heating pads by now) but do last 8 hours at a time and provide intense enough heat. Also, this disposable product is surprisingly comfortable to wear and more directly applies heat to the area where I need it.

If you need intense heat for a sore back, I'd skip this heating pad

Thought this would save time and be easier than a blow dryer and round brush, but no. My hair is long-ish and kind of fine/straight. The brushes would not grab the hair enough like my regular round hair brush. So, I couldn't get the  full volume results I wanted. I can see how those with thick or wavy hair would fare better. It is very loud though. I returned mine

I thought this hot air brush would make things easier by not having to hold a round brush and blow dryer. It's a great idea, but it just doesn't work as well as that. 

First let me say I have shoulder length, normal hair, but a lot of it. If I air dry, it is slightly wavy. I used the larger of the two brushes and found it couldn't get through my hair. So then I was using a second hand to try to push the hair against the brush so it would curl around it. That didn't work very well, and I wound up burning my hands more than once. I also found that I couldn't get the same nice curl with this hot air brush that I could get by using a regular round brush and dryer. 

The other major problem was that the brush got extremely hot. If you have an idea that you'll be able to change from the larger brush size to smaller (or the unit without the attachment) or vice versa, you won't without getting burned. The attachment--even the end of the blow dryer itself--is simply too hot to touch. I was doing things like using a hand towel to try to change attachments. 

The size and shape of the unit is also not optimal. I found it too large and awkward to use. The off button is located right where your hand is, so it's easy to bump. Also, there's no cold shot. If you've come to appreciate what that can do for setting a curl, you'll probably miss it like I did. 

Additionally, as another person has mentioned, the unit is very loud. You would be wise to buy a couple foam ear plugs if you are determined to keep this brush and keep your hearing. I don't believe I read any warning about the noise, either. It's much louder than my traditional guy-style blow dryer. 

Time wise, I found that I spent much longer trying to get my hair dry, and then I wasn't fully satisfied with the style as well as the burns and hassle involved in getting there. I gave this a try for a few days and then returned it to the store for a refund. It made me appreciate the traditional blow dryer and round brush. Some things are just not as good as they seem.

First of all, let's talk about the noise level on this thing.  YIKES!  That should be against some kind of consumer protection law. The blowdryer part is ok, but didn't like the brushes at all.  I'll go back to my Conair stying brush and my straightener.

I thought buying a item with a well known name as this would be great.  I would have hoped the price would even out my possible satisfaction for this product.  Also I loved the pink.  When I opened the box the plates on the flat iron were hanging off.  I tried to snap them into place but they would not stay.  For the amount of money I payed i expected a much better product.  Needless to say i returned it the next day.

     I'm not sure how reliable these types of thermometers are so I don't know whether to say this one or these types are not very reliable.  Either way it is really hard to get a correct temperature or to know if you have gotten a correct temperature with this thermometer.  I follow the instructions and have to repeat them over and over before I get a consistent reading.  I threw mine away

This is the most innacurate thermometer I have ever come across.  Each reading seems to increase or drop by 1 degree or more.  Moreover, the battery only lasts for 1-2 uses.  Granted, one needs to take 10 readings to get a general idea of the correct temperature, but you would think the battery could last a few more times.  When you have a sick child, accuracy and time are of the essence

I ordered the product thinking that it should be good for the price. But it doesnot keep the warm water warm for 10 mintues. The pedicure set is hard to use. The bubbles are not effective.I guess cheap is expensive!!!

I bought this a few months ago, and after about three or four shaves it stopped working properly. It yanks on the hairs instead of cutting them, which is very painful! It doesn't pull them all the way out, which is even worse because it means you have to go over and over the same spots if your desperate enough to continue.  Sometimes it works okay, but what good is a razor that only works half the time? Others here have noted the short battery life and change in sound when it's losing power. Mine does sound "slower" when it's yanking the hair, but that doesn't seem to be related to battery charge (e.g. it can start the shave in evil hair-pulling mode, and then straighten up and shave right five minutes in!) Even when not pulling hair, the shave is not close. Definitely find a different razor

I would give it negative stars but that wasn't an option. This thing is horrible...doesn't cut very close, certainly doesn't hold a charge, engine noise slows down and dies out after about 5 minutes. And oh yeah...the horrible razor burn!!! Seriously the razor burn was horribly painful even with shaving creams

The battery life is the worst of any electric razor I've ever used.  The razor doesn't provide a close shave and mine broke after just three uses.  The razor is very cheaply constructed and I would not recommend this to anyone.  You're better off spending twice the money to get a durable machine

I complete disagree with the previous review on that Sonicare is superior.  I've used all of the sonic toothbrushs on the market and Braun Sonic Complete is by far the best.  However, this unit is NOTHING like Sonic Complete, the sonic energy is completely in the handle, it's like holder a vibrator.  The real Sonic Complete channels the energy to the brush head...  You are probably better more with one of the other two models of Vitality that uses rotational brush heads

Pull ups are NOT very good for potty training, they are for parents who are too lazy to take their kids to the bathroom.  Potty training does not include using diapers.  That is what these are is fancy diapers.  If you want to potty train your kids put them in real underwear or training pants with a plastic cover on them.  The wetness liner is a joke.  These also give kids the impression that if they do not want to go to the bathroom they can just go in their pants

When I gave birth I had already bought packages of newborn huggies. They were horrible. I thought once my boys got older that maybe huggies would work then. NOPE. I've tried Huggies Supreme and the cheap huggies. They are both made horribly and after your child goes in them once they sag so bad you have to go change them. I thought since everyone always talks about pull-ups that they would work once potty training time came around. WRONG AGAIN. They leaked evertime he wore them. Do not waste you money. I always ended up going back to the pampers swaddlers, cruisers, and training pants. Pampers are the best.

Because if you do, this is the unit to do it with! The combination of a demineraliztion cartridge that does not work and/or the silver stick has resulted in the total coating of my new macbook pro's internal circuitry with metal deposits. No, I do not work in a metal shop. I use my computer solely in my apartment room. Yes, it is from the humidifer. The dispersion pattern is heaviest around the fan intake areas.

The topmost review described these batteries as "AA in a D package," which is entirely correct.  What certain loser battery brands like Energizer do is put a AA battery in a D-sized sleeve, thereby hoodwinking unwary consumers into purchasing an inferior product that holds a much smaller (approx 2500 mAh) charge than a "normal" D cell (9000+ mAh.)  Fortunately, these bogus D cells are easy to spot if the manufacturer prints the maximum charge on the packaging--that is, 2000-2500 mAh, which is AA cell territory.  Additionally, the fakes are much lighter than the genuine article--inside is mostly air.  Too bad I mistakenly bought a package of these.  I'll have to settle for consoling myself by boycotting Energizer for the rest of time.

Top of the line (April 2005) D-cell NiMH batteries have 11,000 mAh compared to this one 2,200 mAh (they cost 16 bucks but 10,000 mAh battery costs six bucks). Top of the line AA NiMH batteries have capacity of 2500 mAh. Top of the line NiCad D-Cell batteries have 5000 mAh capacity (costs around five bucks). I thought that NiMH was more capable than NiCad. True, but not in this case.

So what are we gettting here? Higher AA battery capacity in D-cell case. This battery is overpriced for what it delivers.

I bought 8 size D's for my boom box thinking it would be the answer to having to buy batteries every few camping trips.  Wrong answer.  I was able to play 2 1/2 CDs before my box was out of juice.  Game over.  I realize these batteries lose their charge quickly by sitting around, but these batteries were fresh off the charger when I left.  I figured they'd at least last into the night, but they were finished before sundown.  Don't believe anyone who says these are for high drain devices...  I got fooled.  Fool me once, shame on you.  We can't get fooled again

I travel 2-3 weeks a month for work and I needed a hairdryer that was better than the 1000 watt hotel dryers, so after some research I decided to purchase the travel-size T3. 

During the first time I used it, it started smoking and the coils in the back flared up and caught on fire. (There were actual flames -- although they quickly burned out)

I took the dryer back to Sephora and I was quickly given a replacement.

While I had dryer #2, I noticed that it took 15-20 minutes to dry my hair, when it usually takes 20-30. However, I have the full size T3 at home and it takes about 10 minutes when I use that one.  I was expecting this to offer the same power as the other T3.  The bottom line is that I didn't notice a big difference between the travel T3 and the hotel hairdryers that are built into the bathrooms. 

After 6 months, the handle broke on the 2nd hairdryer making it rather challenging to use. 

If you want a great hairdryer, buy a full size T3, Elchim or Chi Pro -- if you need something to travel with, you're better off with finding space for the full size model.

I bought this scale because I figured the price was right.  Well, as they say, you get what you pay for.

First of all, it is flimsy in construction.  I am under 200 lbs., yet when I step on it, the cheap plastic bends down.  You can just feel how thin and unsubstantial the plastic is.

Next, the first time I weighed myself, I found that I had lost 7 lbs. overnight!  If only this were true.  I didn't believe it.  I stepped off and got back on and I had gained back 5 of the lost pounds.  Off and on again -- and I was up another 4.

If you like to just kind of average your many readings, then this scale will work for you.  Otherwise, take a pass.

BTW, and I was using it on a flat hard surface.

We already owned a different HoMedics sound machine and it's far better than this one.  The volume control doesn't work well at all on this machine; either far too low or way too loud and there was lots of static, no matter where we used the machine.  The product seemed very flimsy as well.  We ended up returning it and will spend more for a better machine

My one star rating is for Amazon's service, not the WaterPik attachment, which I never received.  Despite the fact that I ordered this on 20 February 2007 and shipping was stated to be 7-9 days (and is still stated to be 7-9 days), TWO weeks later Amazon has contacted me that shipping on this item will not be until 5-9 April 2007.  I have canceled the item and ordered from another internet store and should receive this in a few days.

In my many years ordering from Amazon, I have found it's best not to order any items with any type of shipping delay, as shipping almost always takes far longer than promised.  I don't understand why Amazon can't keep better track of their inventory

I purchased the Waterpik NA-2 gentle sinuse rinse attachment, expecting it to work with the Waterpik Professional Ultra Dental Water Jet, since that is what was advertised. THEY DON'T FIT IN THIS MODEL, SO DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME PURCHASING BOTH TOGETHER! The sinus attachments are too short, so they can't "click" into the water pik. The end result: Water leaks out, and there is no pressure through the sinus attachment. I had to return both items since the Amazon rep couldn't find any sinus attachment to work in the Waterpik Ultra model. It's a shame because I love the small footprint of the Waterpik Ultra, and it comes with a lot of cool attachments. Hopefully Waterpik will come up with something in the near future

I bought this shaver about one year ago. For years I was using Braun shavers and was happy with them but decided to try competition. In spite of few people on internet who mentioned short lifespan I gave Panasonic a try.

Shaving is fine, it runs quiet and you get 5-7 shaves with one charge.  After about one year it started making strange noise and you get only 3-4 shaves with one recharge. Month later slowly went dead. Exactly as some other people wrote on bulletin boards, what make me to believe to those people writing reviews. 

You would expect more shave for $100. Today I went to buy Braun shaver.

I owned this set for about 2 and a half years before I finally just gave up and switched to a different brand of hot rollers (I used it about 4-5 times per year). First off, the rollers are very heavy so when you have them all in place, it feels like you are carrying a laundry basket on your head. Second, the rollers are hot to the touch so burning can be an issue when rolling up your hair. Third, the clips used to hold the rollers in place are fantastically difficult to use. I would roll up my hair (which would take like, 30 minutes because of the difficulty), and if I walked around the house to watch TV while I waited for my hair to set, the clips would spring out of place and shoot across the room. I eventually lost like 6 clips from the "springing out" thing. 

The results of these rollers were great, though. I used them on my wedding  day and people loved it. Good results, but not worth the time and effort to use these rollers

I purchased two Aquis Microfiber, Waffle, White (19 x 39 inches) Towels.  Although
they are quite expensive, the positive reviews made them sound great.  Well, they
are not.  The towels are quite thin, and do not rub/slide well on the skin.   They give
the feeling of having a rubbery coating of some kind which makes them wad up when
you rub your skin.
They are the same thickness as a dish towel, so we are using them to blot the dishes
when they come out of the dishwasher.
Save your money on this one!

I've only used the unit 3 times, and the flip-over trimmer broke when I "flipped" it over to attach to the main clipper head. The plastic attachment for the flip over trimmer is supposed to fit over the main head, that cracked in two, and about 8 pieces scattered on the floor. It's very disappointing. I'm hoping the rest of the unti will perform for longer, I can't seem to find the receipt

This review covers the FB11NR: same unit with slightly different control pushbuttons and with an IR remote.

Somehow, i had deluded myself into thinking that the spinning massagers under each foot were powered. Nope... basically just built-in plastic versions of those usually wooden massaging rollers that one rolls one's foot upon. That's fine, yet when i want to relax, i'm not thinking about moving my feet. Fortunately, those are removable, and removal is exactly what happened.

The killer was that the center massage wheel, which IS supposed to be powered and IS supposed to spin, was D.O.A. This unit went back to the store, and we bought an FB21 instead. Amazon has no listing for that model, so i can't give a full review on it. It was good enough to keep.

Both the FB11NR and the FB21 share some traits. Neither one really keeps water anywhere near its original temperature. Sound levels vary from fairly quiet to quite loud, depending upon the operating mode chosen (i did dB measurements on the FB21, but since Amazon doesn't list that one, you don't get to see them). The FB21 seems to have slightly better build quality, and everything worked out of the box, so we kept that one

I agree with the other reviews. It was a huge disappointment that it didn't heat the water. It is only supposed to maintain the temperature, but after using it for about 20 minutes, it didn't even do that. The manual rollers hurt my feet and it sloshes water around and spills it when you move your feet back and forth. Back to the store indeed

A fine example of how fickle or intimate (I prefer the word intimate) scent is to each of us. This is one fragrance that I have not gotten to like. Received as a gift more than a year ago, the bottle still has three-quarters. It does have a `rich' scent but I find it to be too confusing and indescribable a scent, not educing a one word description like `sporty', `sexy', `alluring'. I don't wear it very often but I don't recall a single occasion of `what fragrance are you wearing?' with this one. It's just not my cup of tea so definitely, if you're not familiar with this scent beforehand; do not buy before trying it out at a department store for a day. Why Buy? As a gift for the guy competing for the female that is currently in your crosshairs. As a gift for your boss - you will know he's coming from a mile away. You need a gift for a guy who couldn't pour water out of a boot even if there were instructions on the hee

I purchased this lumbar support for a recent back problem. Big mistake! It simply will not stay put no matter what chair I tried it with. The arch that is supposed to help relieve back pain and give support is just too much, it has you bending over backwards. I believe it actually made my back ache more.

I bought this product in Rite Aid. 
Unfortunately, it irriates my face. 
They are scamming people just to buy this product. 
Instead of repairing my face, this product damage my face.
There are a lot of wierd red spot that grows on my face since I start using this. 
Now, I need to go to the dermatologist and have a surgery due to this product. 
If I knew this will happen, I will not waste my money to buy this product.

IT does NOT work the same and the product is NOT the same.  I MUST clarity that...  I dont want to confuse anyone here.
Youthful Essence for instance is NOT pasty or harsh, or gritty.
IT is very smooth, and makes yours skin incredible and soft

Our first unit lasted about almost 2 months. Despite the relatively short lifespan, I thought the product was worth it considering the dirt-cheap price. However, the second unit we got leaked water at the base during its first use; so, it went back to Amazon the very same day it arrived our home. This product is so dangerous. Without exercising some safety precaution, it can cause electrocution!

We bought this at suggestion of our dentist.  However, it is difficult to use, extremely messy and the on/off button on handle is difficult to press.  We used it a couple of times but have not used it since because of messiness and inconvenience.

Our neighbors bought the same model, tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave.

Save your money and go back to flossing!

I had to return my recent purchase due to a defect.  I have used WaterPik Dental Water Jets for many, many years and typically have to replace every two or three years.  I was disappointed to receive a defective product but began shopping locally for another dental water jet.  I purchased the WaterPik Ultra, and I am pleased with the design, size and operation thus far.  I just hope WaterPik can maintain quality of their products and that my current purchase will provide another two to three years of service

I purchased this dryer because of the shape and attachments and wanted to try an ionic dryer. First of all, if this is an ionic dryer I was better off with my super cheap dryer. Second, the back seam of the dryer melted!! Several people have mentioned that it overheats and they are not lying. It shuts off and refuses to come back on. Which is good because then it might melt completely. Don't waste your money on this

This dryer made my wavy hair straighter than a seperate brush and dryer ever could.  THe problem is that it just shuts off.  The first time I used it, it shut off twice within a 20-minute period.  It wouldn't restart when I plugged it back in, or even when I tried a different outlet.  No matter what I tried, it wouldn't restart for about 5 minutes.  I've used an older model of this dryer and the same thing happened.  I wouldn't recommend buying this product

Seriously, I don't know how anyone can use this thing.  I have had tatoos, waxing, and dental fillings, and I would rather have any and all of those before I ever try this product again.  It feels like an electric shock and continuous pulling of duct tape on your skin.  Just awful.  In the products defense, I don't think there is a way to make this device easy to use and leg friendly (God forbid you try it anywhere else, ladies!!).  I was able to remove the hair from about 2 inches of my leg and I gave into the pain and went back to shaving.  Yikes

When I bought this, the other review wasn't posted yet. Now, please benefit from our two reviews. This thing is a total joke. Useless, too small (I have larger hotel samples). I too would like to return this, but I just don't have time before Christmas. Amazon should NOT offer this item. It is a complete let down, over priced and just a joke. No fooling

This is a cheap plastic (except for the metal tube)toy. It's like those hand claws for kids. You squeeze the handle and the claw closes. The grabber part on this thing has a 2 1/2" opening. You won't be able to grab a small can of soup. The magnet is weak and is located on the outside of one of the grabber finger. On the inside of the fingers, they have rubber pads that are removable (probably for cleaning) but they seem to come off on their own

If you have the Philip's Sonicare brand electric toothbrush, don't buy this unit, they do not fit in slots.I had to return mine, and am out shipping, handling, & return shipping charges. Just an FYI, if your electric brush head is any bigger than a standard size toothbrush, (diameter) don't buy it either, it won't fit. They do have a model ESA302 that works with the Sonicare, but it is alot larger

I bought this product a few months ago and now it has stopped working. 
Ans I do agree, the smaller the hair straightener, the better (I originally had a smaller one, that my salon uses, but it also stopped working). 
The light is on, and the heat comes off and on randomly. 
Very upsetting.

I saw a commercial, I read a reviews - and so I bough one box at Walmart. It's not worth it, that's my conclusion. The trays are made of very thin plastic-like material, and are very difficult to position properly on your teeth. The active gel easy goes out of trays, and fills your mouth. During first couple od uses, after 20 min or so I started to feel a vague pain in my gum.  Nevertheless, I continued using the product for all 7 days, as advertised, 30 min a day. After the whole package was gone, the change of color of my teeth is barely visible. I hope you will have better luck.

It was an awkward mess - smushing gel over my teeth with a piece of flimsy plastic that barely adhered, much less fit securely.  It'd probably be easier without the trays.  I don't know if they work or not.  I gave up.  I want my Crest Whitestrips back

After user #1 I was REALLY impressed.  My teeth were noticeably whiter--almost gleaming.  After use number two I noticed a bit more whitening but not as dramatic.  On use # 3 I felt some discomfort after putting the trays in.  After about 1/2 hour it was really starting to hurt and I thought something must be wrong so I took them out.  My gums were bleached white!

I was really freaked out by this but for the most part it did subside after about 1/2 an hour.  However, there was some lingering damage done that, while not severe, is annoying (there is still a slight bit of bleeding).  I have perfectly healthy gums so I was surprised by this...the third tray did some fairly serious damage to otherwise healthy gums.

My advice, if it hurts at all that is not normal and you should take them out

For the price you cant beat this product, IF the problem I'm experiencing can be solved. 
I bought two of these brushes, one for my home bathroom and one for my work-out bag. Love the price and timer feature... 
But it seems that once I've used up the power in the brush, it wont recharge properly. I'm experiencing this problem with both brushes no matter how long I leave it in the charger.
If there is a simple fix for this then I'd say 5 stars. If not, then 2 Stars is well earned, seeing as how I've been on their support line waiting (as I type this) for over an hour

Skip this entire product. I made the mistake of purchasing it and stocked up on the scrubbing and non-scrubbing (mopping?) pads. Now, I can't find the non-scrubbing ones anywhere in my entire county. I think they don't want to compete with their own product "Swiffer" which they also manufacture. I emailed them and they suggested I buy online. I checked walgreens.com and drugstore.com and no luck. I imagine they will phase this out and you will be stuck with a wasteful "who gives a hoot" rod.

I have three bathrooms used by two teenagers and their friends, a toddler and her friends and so they need heavy duty cleaning every week. A neighbour suggested the Mr Clean to me saying it really cut down on her cleaning time and she didn't have to wreck her back scrubbing the tub.  I am disappointed with it. The one thing I did like was the pole. I was able to scrub the tub, the tile on the walls without needing to overreach. That said, I really had to scrub hard to get the grime off the tub, and still couldn't get it all until I used my regular scrub brush. I think I was expecting this to be a way that I could do a lighter clean in between the heavy duty ones but obviously not so. The other thing that bothered me was that you have to RINSE off the stuff after you scrub; from watching the commercial I feel misled because you get the impression that you just scrub and you're done. At least it wasn't that spendy so I don't feel too bad about the wasted money

I got this device to help me clean around my place.  I thought it would be easy to use, and it is  not.  The pads do not stay on.  When you are trying to put them on, the solution leaks all over you.  After working on my shower, I saw no difference.  I wish there could be negative stars because that is what this piece of junk is worth.

i guess it's cheap, but the dial rocks like crazy when you stand on it and shift your weight, so it's pretty hard to get anything more than a ~2-3 pound estimate. which is fine if you're not obsessive, but most people care about that increment...

I really like my electric toothbrush from OralB so I thought I would like this too. However, it just doesn't work. The cartridges they have set up don't work because as soon as you tug on them at all, the floss becomes loose and therefore won't vibrate - it only vibrates if it's taut. But because of the way they have the cartridges set up, there is no way to make it taut again. It would have worked if instead they had used a roll of floss and let you feed it through yourself as needed, but they were too greedy and wanted to sell lots of cartridges.

This would be ok if you got lots of use out of the cartridges, but in my experience they broke halfway through a single use. So... forget it

In my experience with this product, I had NO SIGNIFICANT HAIR GROWTH. Very disappointing for the amount of money you spend on it, and the amount of pills you have to take daily(UGH!). However, I gave it a two because while it didn't grow my hair, it did change the texture of it. My natural hair is very coarse, and while using the HF37 it became really soft, silky and manageable. Nice, if that's what you're looking for a hair vitamin to do. But as far as hair growth...ABSOLUTELY not recommending HF37 for that

Bell Harrah is so right! This things is indeed garbage! I have been using this things since March 9, 2005 and there is very LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR. It still breaks, for goodness sakes, and where is the hard nails that is also suppose to result from using these pills?! It makes me wonder what the hell this thing is doing to my body, as it has not helped my hair and this month of May makes it 4 months I have been using. YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO SEE SOME HUGE CHANGES WITHIN A MONTH TO 45 DAYS, AND NOT ONE DAMN THING HAS HAPPENED!!!!!!!!! AND THE PILLS ARE SO DAMN EXPENSIVE!. i really don't have $57 to throw a way a month, so when you spend that amount of money you are really hoping that something will work. I agree with the previous reviewer-DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY

This is worthless and they say it's refundable, until you read the fine print and realize it's only if you bought the entire product line. It is crap and doesn't do anything. Don't waste your money, drink milk and your hair will grow. This does not work

I agreed with all the criticism that the Revlon eyelash curler (now discontinued) received. It broke quickly and used up batteries by the truckload. But the one thing it did well that the Carmen curler does poorly is to provide the type of construction and shape that keeps you from accidently squeezing pieces of eyelid skin. This instrument catches my skin very easily and it's hard to get good curled lashes without hurting my eyelids

The batteries that come with this charger we're not a problem for me.  In fact, I was surprised that they were fully charged right out of the package and seem to work fine.  I was however, disappointed in the charger.  The charger requires that all four AA batteries be in the charger for it to work.  You cannot charge just one, two or three batteries because the circuit is not complete without all four batteries inserted. Also, there are a maximum of two slots for AAA batteries and when they are in use none of the other AA slots are usable.  Given the price of NiMH batteries, the charger works out to be about $2... which is about what it's worth at best.

Amazon is claming:
*	Great entry-level charger system 
*	Charges four AA / AAA NiMH batteries in 6-10 hours 
*	Includes four 2300mAh NiMH AA batteries 
It is only 1800mAh which makes these rechargeable an average capacity by today standards, while if it was as Amazon claims it would have been a nice step up. Shame on Amazon, oversight or misrepresentation. Charger is cheaply made. It can charge 4 AA or only 2 AAA. Poor design. The charger that came with my camera can do 4 AAA, go figure. Get something else.

we bought this as a cheap/easy stocking stuffer. It's simply not woth anything.  The little file is a good idea, but too tiny to actually work.  My daughter (8yrs old) liked the idea too, but was sad that she couldn't work with the tiny strip that's too short for even her little fingers. Cute, but not worth it

The reviewer who compared the massage feature to that of a cell phone perhaps said it best, so suffice it to say that one can essentially ignore that aspect of the unit [I might even liken the vibrations to those of an injured (and no longer airborne) housefly buzzing in circles]. With respect to the heat(ing), it does perform better, but is by no means stellar. 

The Pro's are its design for moisture, a better-than-average fabric/material - which holds its shape fairly well and the auto shut-off. 

The Con's include, as others have said, a HUGE AC-DC plug/power pack, no apparent ability to WASH the darn thing, only modest heat, annoying Velcro straps, a two-part power cord that not only must be taped to keep together, but can't be removed from the main pad for washing AND, perhaps most significantly, the fact that mine died after approx. 18 months (which, incidentally, raises yet another detractor; the Warranty is only a year, much less than many other brands)

If you're just mixing non-gas-forming drink mixes, this thing works acceptably well, but if you're mixing something like "Ionic Fizz" magnesium drink that fizzes up a bit, it's not very useful because it just doesn't form a very good seal, no matter how tightly you close it. As another reviewer mentioned, it's very easy to cross-thread the lid.  Thicker threads and deeper threads would probably help.

It is great for sipping though, and easy enough to keep clean. But I went back to using a plastic 16-oz milk bottle that always forms a tight seal when you close it. The seal on this bottle is too flaky because it's difficult to tell if you've cross-threaded it until you start shaking it. 

I'd have expected a bottle designed for shaking and mixing drinks would have paid a little more attention to the problems this has. I don't use this any more, because it's too annoying to worry about the seal and the cross-threading. Don't waste your money on it.

At first, this seems like a pretty good drink shaker.  The body and lid are fairly sturdy.  However, there's a separate rubber seal that sits inside the lid...  And if that pops out, which it's prone to do with mine, you're left with a leaky (and therefore useless) shaker.  The seal can be replaced with a bit of effort, but who wants to wrestle with a plastic bottle

This item is totally uncomfortable to sit on and makes your back ache horribly.  Also it does not work well at all.  If you have difficulty rising from a seated positon this item will not help in the least. Many times it stays flat and when it does "rise" it only occurs after you push up yourself with your arms and legs. I would have returned the item, but I left it for my mother when I had to be out of town for a few weeks and by the time I returned my 30 day window was closed.  DO NOT BUY, you will regret it if you do. I won't even put this item in a yard sale, because I would not subject anyone to false hope and a back ache to go along with it.

I read the directions and followed them to a T. The pain was just too intense (on my gums - they started to bleed!). I tried to adjust the "trays" every which way, but there was no way not to get the gel on my gums. After all the time, trouble and pain, I didn't see ANY improvement in whiteness. I have used the older Crest Whitestrips, and liked them much better.

I have tried other products before and this one gets the whitest results the fastest.  HOWEVER, I was in so much pain about 5 hours afterwards that it even hurt to swallow Advil.  I used Sensodyne and a flouride mouthwash to try to help, but nothing seemed to work.   The taste isn't bad and I used the bleach with my own trays that I had made by my dentist, so it didn't leak out or touch my gums.  My teeth weren't sensitive while I was using it or even right afterwards, but later in the day.  If you have sensitive teeth, I do not recommend this product unless you are willing to go through the pain

We recently bought the same model dispenser, but in the satin finish.  From the first, only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps didn't work (yes, we followed the instructions carefully).  Two months later, another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable.  Instead of this loser, try "The Dispenser 71450 Classic IV." We had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age. It's harder to fill than the AVIVA and not as pretty, but so what -- it works, and the AVIVA doesn't.

I eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it's retractable cord and folding capabilities. Even the price was attractive. It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus. I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly. Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers. When I've replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  I'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer's lifespan.  I've now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan.

Ok...received this item last night...used once, and in the process realized I was pointing a laser beam on my skull.  Given the directions say 3 times a week, 15 minutes per, I would have to do this for a long time with no proven results...Save yourself the time...do this...Go to google and type in "Forum and HairPro".  You will find next to nothing regarding information for this product.  I made an impulse purchase getting sucked in to the exploitation...after further research even the top rated hairmaxx brush selling for $500 has mixed results on the online forums.  Not to mention that Viatek had spelling errors in the pamphlet that came with the product...If they don't have the time to make sure all is spelled right in the manual, how much time did they spend creating the actual product.  The box had a date of 2005 and there was dust all over it.  These lasers may work, but with all the research I did (after the purchase) results seem minimal for all the work that needs to be done.  I felt ridiculous using the thing too.  I am just annoyed because again I got sucked into a new gimmick for something that companies can exploit in individuals.

These are just OK, not great. I have 2 pairs of the clic readers and I love them. The sunglasses, however, are not as sturdy, the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and I just cannot endorse them. I am disappointed as I am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses. It's a shame

I bought this and it worked fine the first time that I used it.  Granted, it was late summer and the house was pretty warm so it was not to difficult to steam up the bedroom.  However, I have tried it in my infant's room 4 times this winter.  I used HOT water & salt to try to help it, but the darn thing does not have enough power to make the steam.  Maybe all of the "steam" energy is being used on the night light!  If you have your home's thermostat set under 78 degrees, do not waste your money on this item!  Find something stronger to get you through the winter months

NO MOVING PARTS contrary to depiction above. The "attachments" are tiny plastic 1.5" knobs that attach to a motionless center peg over which you are supposed to rub your feet! They do not move. There is no massaging action - YOU DO ALL THE WORK, making your hips and knees sore. The "massaging foot beds" are totally motionless and form a spiky, painful surface. Vibration setting creates an annoying buzzing sensation over whole device. Jets are totally underpowered. No fill line indicator so "Bubbles" spill water onto floor. Heater is completely useless - after 15 minutes water temp was no different. Cannot return because water ruins loofa and epsom salt pads. Classic deception in advertising

I cannot address the value of buying products from this manufacturer; that's for you to decide.

However, this product performs noticably worse than its earth-unfriendly alternatives.  Clothes come out greyish and stains are not as well removed as with Tide, the other one I use.

But the decision is yours

A total Piece of Garbage, do not buy this at all.

First of all it is battery operated which i did not know when i bought it.  Secondly, when i went to put batteries in it, the terminals in side of it are offset, one is higher than the other, and the higher terminal was damaged.  When i put the batteries in and put the cover on it did not work, the case was pushing the battery away from the terminal.  It worked without the cover on but that doesnt do anyone any good if u cant prevent the batteries from falling out.  The thing is rather loud too and cover is a piece of cheap plastic.   The thing is a Piece of Garbae, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!

This protien works well to curb my appitite for hours on end, but it has a horrible taste and texture.  The closest thing I can relate it to is chocolate-burned egg tasting boogers.  I would not purchase this product again.  I would, however, purchase from the vender again because it is not their fault that this protien tastes so bad

I got one of these to help me after I had major surgery.  I have better than average hand and arm strength, but I found this particular model to be hard to operate (I can't imagine how someone with a weak grip could possibly use it).  Normal sized cans (like soup or beans) slipped out of its pitiful grip.  I wound up using it just to roll things to myself when I dropped them and for picking up clothes for the wash.  This is definitely a lightweight... too light for much real use.  I should have bought the heavier duty version for just a few dollars more

I took a chance (it's pricey) and purchased this item.  &quot;What the heck,&quot; I thought.  I used it (a single 'squirt') once a day in the morning.  This was instead of the recommendation of twice a day.  I like the stuff.  My skin felt lubricated and smooth without feeling greasy.  In fact, I'd give it five stars except that now it's three weeks since I purchased this product and 'poof!' it's gone!  I figure that it comes to about 30 cents a squirt.  In my mind the 'goodness' of this product isn't worth the exorbitant price.  Hence, two stars

I just received my brush(es) hair dryer yesterday 3/9/07 ... tried it out today - for 5 MINUTES ... I absolutely hate it.  It's the worst, by far, hair appliance I've ever owned.  I guess you get what you pay for ... but I've owned Revlon products in the past, and this was absolutely the biggest waste of money.  I cannot return it, because the return cost would be too expensive, too much trouble, and I guess it will go in the dumpster.  I hate it - don't make the same mistake I made.  One big problem is that the bristles are so lousy - not firm and doesn't grip the hair.  Just take it from this written testimony - it's a piece of junk

I like to use the wet wipes, they're good products. I gave only 2 stars because the package wasn't packed well. I received the package this week. All seals of three boxes were broken, lids fell off, and the wipes were everywhere in the package, they were dried up, but the amazon packing box was all soaked wet, and it almost fell apart. What a mess it was!

--as I found it to be really much too fake-lemony, not unlike the stuff you smell in car dealership service bathrooms. I mixed mine w/ a subtle "cookie"-type one I coudn't smell at all & now can smell neither, even when I put them in closets, which was not the idea--I like a little fragrance thru the house. May look for something like cinnamon or sandalwood

the pick at the back of the unit is curved and doesn't work well.

the floss is multi-stranded and tends to come apart when used and doesn't feel like it is very high quality floss.

the head is also somewhat small or poorly shaped so it is also difficult to use.

i used the plackers brand before and was much happier with it

Both my wife and I have high blood pressure, which our doctor would like us to track at home. After checking out many brands and styles of automatic monitors, and based on the reviews here, I didn't hesitate to buy the Mark of Fitness, Inc monitor (Prevention edition).  When I received it, there were two problems: First, there was no owner's manual inside. Since I kept getting an "err 2" message, I had no way of checking what that meant. (Amazon.com suggested I look online for a pdf version somewhere. Unfortunately, the Mark of Fitness' web site didn't have online manuals.)  The second and more important problem with this product was that it was clearly very inaccurate.  When I finally was able to get some readings, they were: 112/64, 106/60, 96/61, 106/62, 109/64, and 115/62.  Oh, how I wish some of those WERE my readings!  Maybe it was just my misfortune to get that one in 500 lemons with no owner's manual and who knows what else wrong with it, but unfortunately, I won't take a chance on trying another one.  It's going back today

I followed the directions on the package but could not get these disks to adhere to my canker sore, even one in the flattest part of my cheek.  Obviously, they won't stick to sores on the gumline or inside of lip either.  CANKAID and Kank+A are still the non-prescription products I have found that provide relief and are much easier to apply

When I ordered this item, I assumed that the flosser attachment would be some sort of gadget to which you would add new dental floss at each use.  Actually, each flosser is a plastic prong with pre-strung floss in it, to be used once and discarded.  Let me see:  a million conscientious users floss daily and you have 365,000,000 plastic doodads added to the world's landfills every year.  I already compromise my principles for convenience more than I'd like to admit.  This is totally over the top.   When I've used up my supply of flossers, out this thing goes.  It goes into the landfill, to be sure.  So don't anyone else make my mistake

I didn't realize there was HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) in these bars. If you work out or are health conscience, then I would suggest doing a little online research about harmful effects of HFCS. I'm about to switch up my protein bars.

If you think you are buying the old Met-RX bars by the same flavors, you are in for a very very bad surprise. The old bars had better taste and a almost cake-like consistency. These were so sticky that I could pick up papers just by touching them after eating one.  Also, I couldn't get past the taste. Even the color is different. 

I never finished the bar and I used to eat one a day (years ago). I gave the entire box away for free.

I will not buy these again until the go back to their old recipe.

This bar is larger that most nutrition or meal replacement bars - that much is true. What is also true is that is contains more fat. 

What you will notice with the first bite, is that the bar seems somehow "inflated". There is an emptiness to consistency of the bar. You are not getting the quality nutrition you would get from a Myoplex or Apex bar. Stick with those brands for pure nutrition and FAR BETTER TASTE. 

These METRX bars leave you feeling as though you've eaten something that was bad for you - like after you eat a dessert, yet these will not be mistaken for desserts

I couldn't even make it to that "magic" fourth or fifth day when all cravings are supposed to magically disappear. From the very beginning, I was so incredibly jittery, which is 1 of the claims Hoodia reps make. I, also feel sleepy all the time, yet I can't nap and my sleep has been severely disrupted by all the jitteriness- I'm what you call TOO TIRED TO SLEEP! REALLY, how many over-the counter appetite suppressants actually work. I believe none of them work better than a placebo (and maybe that's what some of you are experiencing?). DON'T BOTHER WITH this one. A total waste of a lot of money - this stuff isn't exactly cheap, either; take your $$ and go buy some sneakers, get a little exercise & you'll be a lot better off!

These did NOT suppress my appetite, though many days I took 3 tablets three times a day!  Had very good luck with a bottle of Dytrexil (also a Hoodia product), but the next bottle of THAT, nothing.  I guess like crops, you can get good batches and bad batches.  These struck me as a bad batch.  As one reviewer said, I actually felt HUNGRIER many days.  Egad!  Better luck next time!  Sigh

We started getting a "LO" message when using the thermometer. It said that we needed to change the probe tip and clean the lense. This worked for a little while. We changed the tip on each use.  Now nothing works. After spending near $50 on this I feel like a chump. I want to throw it out the window. I'm heading to the drug store now to buy something else

I purchased this because it was so cute, and had the Conair name.  Within 6 weeks, the bulb blew out, and I started looking for a replacement.  Ive been to all the local places, and everyplace I could find online.  In an obscure place I found the bulb with the right voltage but not the right wattage.  The only place I could get the correct bulb was on the conair website -- but they make you buy 10 bulbs, then charge $9.00 for handling.  The cost is more than just buying a new mirror!  a rip off

I have always used foam rubber as a topper over our mattress but changed to this Memory Foam.  After using it for one month, I have taken it off the bed and it is back in the box it was shipped in.  I DO NOT like the Memory Foam at all.  It seems to be great when you first lie down on it and then after a hour or two my body just sinks down until it is against the mattress below it and I am not that heavy a person, 160 lbs. It is so hard to find foam rubber but I will search until I find it and never by Memory Foam again!  Doubt I can get my money back.  Have not talked to the Seller about it

The mattress pad topper has a strong chemical smell. After receiving it, I left it in an open room for 2 weeks before I can sleep on it. The "free" pillow smells even worse. It can be not exchanged since it is "free". I guess I am supposed to toss it since it's "free".                 I think it will be fair to mention that the topper is comfortable, after all.

I'm a huge fan of the Pria line, but these are not like the others - they are heavier and a little grainy.  I don't hate them, but will not buy them again.  The flavor is pretty good though, just not what I was expecting.  I highly recommend the Pria 110 calorie line - the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind.
Thank

These are the best bags out there, but they still aren't good enough

I chose these bags partly because of the reviews that I read on this website and because they made economic sense.  I gave birth to a premature infant who was unable to breastfeed.  I have pumped everyday btwn 6-8 times a day since she was born and was blessed to have an ample milk supply.  However, when thawing these bags out I found that I was losing sometimes 4 and 5 bags of at a time due to leakage not from the double seal at the top, but from a seam at the bottom.  I later tried some of the other bags out there and found that yes, these bags are better than their competitors, but they were not good enough for me. I have worked way too hard to provide my child with nourishment only to have it leak all over the place.  My solution was to use bottles.  They too have disadvantages (take up more room in the freezer), but I feel that they are a better choice

I bought this curling iron impulsively, as I perused through the "gold box" items some time ago.  When I first received the it, I was amazed at how well it worked; it heated up quickly, and did a wonderful job on my hair.  After a couple months, I turned it on, left the room for a minute, and came back to find the tip melted off, hanging from a strand of what little plastic was still attached.  I thought about returning it, but decided (rather stupidly, in retrospect) to continue to use it...BIG MISTAKE.  It heated up way beyond what it should have, even when I put it at a "low" setting of 5.  When I attempted to use it, the sizzling sound indicated to me that I had, indeed, made a mistake.  The next day, coworkers were commenting on my lovely new SHORT haircut.  If you're really interested in purchasing this item, please learn from my mistake, and if the tip melts off, take that as a sign that it will also melt your hair

Perhaps these other people had bought the product before they lowered the quality.  My experience with this product is that it does not cut hardly at all.  I threw the item in the trash and bought a ConAir at Kmart which surprisly worked about 20 times better.  My recommendation is DO NOT BUY

These are a cheap knock off of Huggies Pull-Ups.  And once the side comes apart, you can't put it back together like with Pull-Ups.  Over all a waste of money.  Just use Pull-Ups, they're worth the extra money..

I used huggies pullups with my older child and started using them with my younger one. When they came out with Dora on the easy ups and our grocery store had a huge Dora display, my daughter had to use Dora not the pullups which have the disney princess design which she is not that into(I personally think the disney princesses are not a good choice for potty training age 2-3 year olds, I would assume that Dora would be picked by more children that age). First off the smallest size they have is big for the average 2-3 year old. They did have a size 2t but from what I have seen it has been discountined. I don't know if it is because they are a little big or the quality they do leak. I have never had a huggies pullup leak on me but these easy have on a regular basis. The design definetly got my daughter not wanting diapers and on the road to potty training but the leakage didn't make it easy for me. I would never use these for overnight use, pullups absorb so much better in an overnight situation. Now if pampaers could make a better product or huggies could make a better design then I would be happy

This isn't a bad dryer when it comes to convenience and travelling. However, the folding handle did eventually break and I had to modify it to hold it together. I haven't noticed any benefit from the ion control, mine and my wife's hair get's easily frizzled with this dryer, plus it takes a long time to dry in comparison to what others have claimed. The switch is definitely very difficult to use, there's no way a person can use it with one hand.  If you tried, you'd end up dropping the thing. The fact that the off position is between the two speed settings isn't very good either because you push so hard to move the switch you simply move from high to low instead of to the off position. Personally, I can't wait to find her a better one so I can tear this one apart for more interesting things. On the upside, after fixing the handle, it has worked without any real problems for 6 months

The only reason that I am writing this review is because I am on line now looking for a new trimmer.  I bought this "gem" less than a year ago and was not satisfied then.  Tonight, I'm trying to trim my goatee and it is ripping and pulling the hair out.  The extra cutting heads are all but worthless.  I would never recommend this P.O.S to anybody.
I wish I could give it 0 stars

I bought this product thrilled with the thought that I could use an epilator in the shower.  Even though that's possible, the very last thing this product does is remove hair -- at least with the epilator head.  The shaving head works fairly well, but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better.  I can't believe Panasonic thinks they'll actually keep customers selling something this ineffective

Printed all over the box are the words "with infrared heat".  The instructions state that you must add warm water to the machine before you start, and the infrared mechanism is supposed to maintain the water's warm temperatures.  This wouldn't be the case.  The water cools in a matter of minutes after turning the bubbles and massage functions on.  Turning on the infrared light on top of the machine looks nice, but does nothing at all to keep the water warm.

While the product works it's good.  It was capabable of trimming eyebrows, sideburns, beards & mustaches, and that pesty stray nosehair.  The problem with the MicroTouch is that the motor works for about 6 months and then it is useless.  It is not worth the money. Buy a product that costs more money and is better quality.

It lasted one year and two weeks, then the motor died. While it worked it was great. I am tempted to buy a replacement, but will probably end up trying another brand. The manufacturer is probably banking on people buying several, because when they do work they do a great job

This item was disappointing because the suction cups wont stick to the bathtub unless it's a completely smooth surface.  Most standard tubs have some sort of a nonslip surface

This is another example of a horrible waste of time and money. Our Emjoi products have never lasted longer than 6 months without needing repair. And that brings around another problem -- Emjoi customer service and repair service. You'll want to avoid both. Better yet, avoid Emjoi and avoid the total headache.

Not only are Emjoi products cheap, they are painful to use

This epilator by Emjoi does NOT WORK without the cord attached - the motor is too weak. In addition, the only disks that work at all are the two on the ends - the middle disks, since they are inset from the top, never reach the hair. I had to return this item, and I would not trust or recommend ANY item by Emjoi. Extremely poor quality, and does not work as promised

I bought one last year as it was supposed to be accurate and you could do it yourself.  Doing it yourself is misleading as the directions for one of measuring sites for women require you to hold it in your right hand and measure the back of your right tricep.  Impossible to do both at the same time.  Even with the help of my trainer who is skilled at using calipers it gave widely variable readings and inconsistant results.  The feature that takes your % body fat and classifies your level by age never worked.  Mine was stuck making the classification by the youngest age group for women.  Basically it ignored specific data entered in for age and male/female.   I was very disappointed but was fortunate to get my money back

Edible taste, not the best but I would keep buying them if i didn't get the worst stomach ache that leads to to a dirrahea.  It is not just this met-rx bar that will do this to you, it is any food with sugar alcohols.  All Atkins food is based on sugar alchols such as maltitol and sorbitol.  They do not effect your blood sugar like regular sugars do, so the theory is that they dont store fat.  Only edible if you are within 20 feet of a clean bathroom.  You only have 15 minutes to get to the bathroom.  Not Worth It

Too Expensive Form of Aspirin

Bayer is a name-brand aspirin.  Any brand-name drug will cost at least double of that of the equivalent generic aspirin.  I give this a one-star rating not because it is a poor product, rather, because it is so expensive. The dosage is 81 mg, taken to thin the blood to prevent heart attacks and strokes (generally taken by older individuals who perhaps have arteriosclerosis, have had a heart attack or stroke).  

Aspirin is a wonder-drug, the very first analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to hit the market over 100 years ago. It is for mild to moderate pain and treats many different conditions such as arthritis, bone inflammation, joint pain, and even reduces fever. Aspirin causes blood platelets to not adhere to each other, thus it "thins" the blood and prevents blood clots from forming. Aspirin is thus used in emergency treatment of heart attacks and strokes. Some folks take a "baby" aspirin (81-160 mgs) each day to prevent blood clots from forming. 

Aspirin is actually acetyl-salicylic acid. Manufacturers alter the structure of aspirin slightly to grant it different properties in terms of its digestion, to make digestion easier. Some buffer it with antacids while others coat the tablet with a coating that prevents its digestion in the stomach (like Ecotrin). Regular aspirin, without any buffering or coatings is tolerated by most people, but some cannot take it without severe stomach upset. For these folks, the buffered form is a god-send. 

Unfortunately, Aspirin fell out of favor in the 60's and 70's when Reye's Syndrome developed in some children (under the age of 16) who took aspirin while they had the flu and/or chickenpox. About 30% of the children affected died and many more had permanent brain damage. Because of Reye's Syndrome, alternate analgesics were placed on the market, the premier being Tylenol. There is no reason to fear using aspirin if you are an adult, as Reye's Syndrome only occurred in children under 16 years of age. 

The usual dose of aspirin is 350 mg, with the "extra-strength form at 500 mg. Most adults will easily tolerate a dose of 650 mg (2 tablets) every 4 hours with a maximum daily dose of 5,200 mg. (Some with rheumatoid arthritis take up to 7200 mg/day with a doctor's supervision). There is no additional benefit to taking more than 1,000 mg every 4 hours. Increasing the dose beyond this point will only increase the toxicity of aspirin. 

Aspirin should be avoided in people taking blood-thinning medications, those with stomach ulcers, and used with caution in insulin-dependent diabetics. Allergies can develop to aspirin as well. Never mix aspirin with any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, such as Ibuprofen, as there is no pain benefit and the gastric upset chance is greatly increased. Don't mix aspirin with alcohol either, as it is hard on the stomach. 

Used properly, aspirin is a terrific medication. I prefer to buy my aspirin in a generic form. One pays more for aspirin if it is produced by a name-brand manufacturer. However, the big-manufacturers also package aspirin in some of the buffered forms that some people tolerate better.

I paid 50 bucks for a pen that is already leaking on its third day of use. The craftsmanship is shoddy. The packaging itself has nicks on it. The pen is leaking from the silver ring above the first one. I've had to use scotch tape on it so that it doesn't keep staining my fingers. The box says made in China, and well quite frankly, the product seems to be exactly that, made in China.

I always thought Cross was suppose to be a good brand of pens, but I now know they aren't. The problem for me is I ordered 3 of these pens and one ball point one all at the same time so I could give a few of them away as gifts. What am I going to do now? This bites

After using the dryer (which I liked very much and did a quick job), I discovered that my hair was being ruined.  It would break off in small 2 inch curved pieces.

I stopped using it for a month and confirmed that was the problem because the lavatory was no longer filled with broken pieces of hair.

I would like to return it and get my money back!!!

Absolute waste of money, this is not a Pillow as advertised, in my opinion falsely, but a flat mat which, when filled with water is a very heavy weight and it is not possible to sleep on this. You could use it to wipe your feet on but thats all. An extremely disappointed customer who suffers from overheating badly in bed and thought this was a great solution. Now out of pocket and no better off.

I got this as a gift for Christmas, and I've tried it twice so far. Both times I get the same result - it doesn't work. I understand that with wet hair, it won't dry it, obviously. But even with damp hair, as instructed, it doesn't get my hair dry. As for the actual straightening aspect, I still end up with frizzy hair that isn't even all that straight. It's not worth the money - spend the extra bucks and get a Chi or Infrashine, you'll be a lot better off

I wanted a good reading lamp and bought this lamp after doing a bit of research.  After taking the very heavy lamp out of the box and assembling it, I turned it on to find that it gives off very little light.  I thought it might be something I would need to get used to and sat down that night to read only to find that my eyes were straining under the light.  I tried using the lamp during the day/twilight and found that the illumination of the lamp was barely noticable.  Though it was quite a feat to put the lamp back into the box it was shipped in, I returned it to Amazon which is something I rarely do

this shampoo made my dandruff even worse.  after using it, it did make my scalp feel cool and cleansed, but an hour later i combed my hair and there were huge flakes in it.  if you have to pay a little more for a dandruff shampoo buy paul mitchell's tea tree shampoo or something.

I didn't want to spend a lot of money on an Ionic Hair Dryer.  I came across this one and thought I'd give it a try.  The light indicating the Ionic Generator is working stopped working after its first use. What a waste of money!

It's a handy mirror for the price but if your looking for a good vanity mirror, I suggest looking for something larger with a higher magnification.  The light is not great at all.  It's very dim.  One of the good qualities of the mirror is that it's cordless and comes with an adapter if you don't have batteries handy

It's OK that helps to moisturize the skin,
but it's just stays oily and cannot be absorbed appropriately in the skin.

The concept is cute, although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them, but the main problem is that they give you hat hair, compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head.  Regular glasses go in between the hairs, so everything fluffs out.

If you never take off your reading glasses, have a buzz cut, are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head (but be careful of buns), the clic connect reader may be fine for you.  Otherwise, conventional glasses are a better bet

This one's going back to the store.  It has been turned on for almost half an hour and I barely feel the heat.  If you ask me, my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat.  As for the "massage", it's worthless to me, but I am not one for vibrating massage anyway, I prefer shiatsu.  I get cold feet when I am home and not moving around a lot, so I think I will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet

I don't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose. I don't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all; as I said I don't have a huge melon like Mike Myers's brother in "So I Married an Axe Murderer". The idea/concept is great but...I'll probably return them. Unfortunate because I was really looking forward to using them. People with REALLY big heads, caveat emptor

After 5 days of minimal use, this pad stopped working. Kaz replaced it. After 3 days of use, the pad stopped working again. Kaz replaced it again. After 7 days of use, the pad stopped working a third time, but this time Kaz VOIDED the warranty! Then, they said I should get an electric blanket if I wanted to keep warm. I wonder if they really think an electric blanket and a heating pad are interchangeable for soothing a headache or backache

This shaver holds a great charge and you can use it in the shower, but that's about it.  The shave isn't very close, and it takes a long time to shave.  To do your underarms is somewhat painful with the pulling of the razor

This product is called a "Bouffant Style Oversized" shower cap.
It is so small that it would not fit over my wife's head.
The product features list claims it is made of "soft, pretty fabric."
In fact it is made of thin, crunchy plastic.
It is so poorly made that the stiching is crooked, overlaps and has threads hanging in several places.
This shower cap went directly in the garbage

The friend who I purchased this for was not able to use it because it moved too FAST for her to keep up with.  She is used to a two wheeled walker, but wanted one with a seat.  She didn't keep the original packaging so could not get a full refund.  It turned out that return shipping was going to be more than what she would get for a refund; so she didn't return it.  The lesson: better buy local if you're not sure

I ordered the Ergo Lounger.  When I arrived, I was shocked to find that I could barely lift the box that it came in. I wanted to move it to another room to unpack.  This was supposed to be lightweight "aluminum" but the box clearly said "steel."  I did NOT want one that would rust because I intended to carry it to the beach to use it.  I actually called the Manufacturer (they provided a toll free number) several times.  Never did they answer the phone, nor did they ever return any of my calls.  So I could not find out if they thought it was aluminum or not.  The lounger itself seemed pretty nice, just too heavy and probably would rust soon

This is an overpriced, under designed lounger.  The concept is cool, the product is not.  The idea of being able to read while face down is completely useless if you wear glasses.  Very uncomfortable.  I am glad I bought mine from Amazon as opposed to the $200 plus other retailers wanted  last summer

While one would think it would be impossible to foul up such a simple and common tool, the manufacture has indeed done so. The "spoon" portion of this shoe horn is attached to a heavy coil. I supposed this is intended to give the working end some flexibility, but instead of using a fastener or weld, its just rolled metal inserted into the coil. After only two uses the "spoon" came out of the coil and even though I could easily enough put it back together, after a couple of more uses it became so loose it would not stay. Basically its now a shoe horn minus the twenty something inch handle now. Would recommend buying a more simply designed, single piece shoe horn.

i cannot agree with any person who gives this over 1 star. The main problem I had with this product was that it was far too overpowering in the fragrance department. I swear, it was like bathing in GATORADE. And while I'm sure that AXE was going for that whole electrolyte thing in all its glory, but the smell is far too fragrant. And if you think that it has even the slightest bit of an invigorating quality, think again. I was a lot happier with Snake Peel

I ordered this and, while I'm a fan of other Therabeads products, I found this poorly designed.  Unless you have a very thick neck, the velcro straps are worse than useless.  They either get in the way or cling to the fabric cover.  The only way I could get it to fit was to cross the straps in front below the neck -- and then it didn't cover the neck well.

To get hot lather, which is nice, you first have to get the device installed on top the can.  I would not recommend this if you are easily frustrated.  The directions provided are sparse in several languages.  First you have to pry the top off the can of shaving cream.  They provide a pry tool for that purpose which works well on some brands of shaving cream better than others.  Then you have to fit the device on top the can.  It worked well with one brand in a large size can.  When I tried it with a smaller size can of shaving cream it emptied half the can during the installation process.  Using a different brand in a large can, I had trouble prying the top off the can.  If you have time and patience, and are willing to spend some money on various brands of shaving cream to find one that works well, give it a try.  Otherwise, be forewarned it may lead to frustration and bad language. 

It would be nice if companies intending to sell products in the US (apparently manufactured somewhere in Asia) would provide a clear set of instuctions in English, in reasonable large readable type, with illustrations.  In this case, they need to clearly specify the type shaving cream can the unit is designed for.  I do not need instructions in foreign languages, and get tired of limited instructions in six languages

Sorry to say, but this product did not work as promised. The black canister does not hold any type or brand of Lather can, only Gel type cans. I did call the customer service number and asked why this is, and  the rep told me that it is a Type - O on the package. In order to use with a Lather can, you just put the device on the top of the can and use as is. The older Model product did fit the lather type cans, but this one does not. Sorry but if you are going to use this with a lather can, you might want to get the older White Model. The product looks starange when you cant use the Black canister as pictured.

The size is good but the second one we ordered leaked. The cap did not fit... The after taste is not so strong but very difficult to see the difference from an ordinary stainless steel container/warmer which costs only $6-$10 dollars in the market around. Too pricy and the thin plastic cap does not match well with the product

I was disappointed in this product as the bonnet was smaller than the previous dryer I was using by Hot Tools and had problem getting on over my large rollers.  After using about 5 times it stopped working.  I will say that it is compact for travelling but feel that it is undependable.  The temperature did get extremely hot so for a quick dry it was good from that standpoint. I ended up purchasing another Hot Tools Dryer, a little more money but worth the price in the long run

The very first thing I noticed was how small and crammed the case was. It was almost impossible to fit everything back in the case without thinking you have damaged something.
The other thing was how awkward the entire assembly was.  The bonnnet was difficult to get on, mainly because the hose connected to the bonnet was heavy and in an awkward place, and kept pulling the bonnet off my head.
After a couple of trys and reading the instructions, I knew I would never use it, simply because it was such a struggle just to get it on your head.
Whoever designed this product should be demoted

I purchased this product thinking that it will be better than the hand held models or the scale type models, since it combines measurements from hands and feet for a more accurate measurement of body fat.  The scale part works normal, but the Body Fat measurement is higher by 20 - 30%, compared to Tanita BC554 scale or Omron HBF-306C hand held.  Omron, replaced the unit, but the new one is also inaccurate.  Now, I'm tying to get my money refunded, but Omron does not want to take the unit back

Maybe my toenails are just too thick, but this cutter just is not heavy duty enough to cut them... I threw them away upon first use.  My old toenail cutters were the same design but I don't know who made them...they worked fine... heavier duty metal and much sharper.  These are junk IMHO

The idea is fantastic.  The fact is I don't wake up immediately like BZZZZ--I'm awake.  Amazingly I can hit the snooze on a regular alarm without ever knowing it.  On this alarm, the light starts glowing and gets brighter and brighter over a period of time you select.  I have mine set for 15 minutes, and usually by the time the light has reached maximum I'm coherent enough to get up.  If the light doesn't do it, you can add sounds ranging from a buzzer to screeching sea gulls--ocean, wind, and ringing bells falling somewhere in between.

The flaws:  

As others have mentioned, the light itself makes a buzzing noise at low light levels.  So when it first pops on in the morning, you also get the annoying filiment vibration of the lamp.  

Secondly, you don't set the alarm for when you want to get up.  You have to go through some math calculations, figuring out when you WANT to wake up and how long it will take you to get to that point.  Then you set the alarm for that earlier time (awake minus groggy equals alarm time).  

Third, if you use the sound in addition to the light, it does increase in volume as the light increases in intensity, but the sound starts out so loud to begin with that the light is really pointless.  A workaround we've found for this is to use the external speaker provided.  Plug it into the back of the light, run it across the room, and bury it upside down under some pillows.  Then pick a sound like "Birds" instead of the lip-curling "Harbor" or "Town".  From it's buried location across the room, the sound hits the right volume about the time the light maxes out.  Whoever came up with the plan of making the sound come on with the light was just not thinking.  

Fourth, the clock lumination can change colors, rotating through the entire rainbow all night long in its default setting.  At first that looks cool.  Until you realize a bright yellow clock glowing in your face at 2 a.m. is just wrong.  The darkest setting is red, and the only way to choose it is to hit a pause button on the back when it rotates around to that color.

So yes, it works.  And it wakes me up without making me use my hammer.  But the design is just plain stupid.  If the manufacturer would wander by here, read this and make a few design changes, they could make a light worth buying

If you want my review in a nutshell, here it is: Two Defective Rise & Shine Lamps. One Call to Verilux. Verilux Refuses to Help.

If you wish to learn how this sorry state of affairs came to pass, read on.


My Verilux Product Experience:

I exchanged my first Verilux Rise and Shine Natural Alarm Clock & Bedside Lamp due to a non-functional internal speaker, ostensibly from loose wires that were shaken loose during shipping (if I am to understand the Verilux' company president's response to a similar defect report in these reviews). The good news: The speaker in the second unit now works. And contrary to some of the other reviewers I feel the Mylar speaker sounds quite good -- although dual stereo speakers would have been an even better choice (with a line-in jack for CD player or iPod). The bad: Despite the jumbo LCD display that might lead you to assume that the AM/FM tuner is digital, the radio is completely analog. The station IDs are printed in roughly 7-point type on the tuning dial instead -- small enough that some owners will need their glasses AND a magnifying glass to select a radio station. By contrast, I own an alarm clock by Conair with a similar analog tuner, with the exception that it uses roughly 8-point LCD digits to represent the radio frequency in the lower right-hand corner of the backlit LCD display. On Verilux' comparatively enormous LCD, I am left to wonder why the design team failed to consider that option. An analog tuner without a station display is something I expect from a $15 drugstore alarm clock, but not from a product of this type, which is otherwise very well thought out.

Unfortunately, due to an apparent flaw in the shade and/or the lamp itself, the shade on my replacement lamp -- the lamp I received from the store in exchange -- won't sit straight! One can remove the shade, look at the lamp on a level surface, and see the lamp "shelf" slope downward such that the shade itself also is similarly slanted! Making the situation worse, the lampshade is also slightly off insofar as the ring is not centered. There are three metal supports attached at the top of the shade that are bent downward and welded to a ring that sits about half way down (as typical of most lampshades). The ring, in turn, sits on the lamp body (or shelf). The whole assembly is cockeyed, including the socket into which the bulb sets (at a VERY obvious angle)! 

Cosmetically speaking, there are also problems that are surprising to see in a product of this type. Whereas the first lamp I purchased has a very prominent nick in the plastic edge alongside the LCD panel, the replacement lamp has a scratch in the ivory plastic lamp body about an inch below the shade shelf, and it, too, must have been obtained in manufacturing. 

As for the shade itself, it came out of the plastic wrap with a beige blemish, roughly 3/4", that looks like a pale stain against the bright white linen. So while the second lamp did not have a DOA speaker, I apparently traded one problem in for another. Worse, the lamp appears lopsided even from the opposite side of the room (and would probably appear that way from down the street if I were to set it on the curb). In short, the Verilux Rise & Shine lamp is just not up to the quality that the price/warranty suggests. And in case you are wondering if this might have been "gray market" merchandise, it wasn't. I purchased my Rise & Shine lamp straight out of a high-end, authorized retail store, new-in-box. 

The AM/FM clock radio paired to the sunrise-simulating full-spectrum light, finished off by the eight high-quality digital nature sounds -- contained in a space-saving design roughly 6.5" wide at the base and 20" tall -- makes for an outstanding combination and concept. For this reason, I hope Verilux will continue to refine the Rise and Shine model, particularly where quality control is concerned. 

Given that I am a gadget fan, and someone who has rated products 1/5th the price of this lamp very highly, it should be understood that I really wanted to give this a positive review. But two duds in a row?

IRONY

The Rise & Shine user manual emphatically instructs consumers to contact Verilux directly instead of returning defective products to the retailer. Given that my replacement lamp is also defective, I followed these instructions. But in reality, Verilux wants defective merchandise to become the retailers' problem, not theirs (as per the instruction I received to make a THIRD 40-mile trip back to the store where I purchased it). Conclusion?

VERILUX DOESN'T BACK THEIR WARRANTY (in my experience/opinion).

Nor, apparently, does Verilux care what kind of impression they leave on first-time customers. So if you think the impressive three-year warranty will help you if something should go wrong, consider what happened less than 72 hours into my ownership experience. And believe me, there was no rudeness involved to provoke this kind of reaction on the part of Verilux' customer service department, either.

What Verilux has apparently forgotten is that this is the age of the Internet. As it so happens, I supplement my income writing product reviews for Websites. In fact, I am a writer by training/trade. Translation: Verilux chose the wrong customer to let down. I have no intention of smearing Verilux' reputation -- unless telling the truth and nothing but the truth about my experience qualifies as such.

Would I recommend this product to a friend? Yesterday I might have said yes, chalking up the non-operative speaker in the first lamp to a fluke. Today, coupled with the fact that Verilux seemingly does not wish to stand behind their products even when it would take a mere lampshade to keep a customer happy, my answer is a resounding NO.

Should anyone at Verilux read my review, I wish to close with this thought: I could have learned to live with the cosmetic problems I noted, but a ~$5 lampshade, to replace the one that was blemished right out of the box -- and doesn't sit straight, to boot -- is that not worth keeping a first-time customer happy?

Waking up to this product's sound and light is delightful.  Trying to read, at night, by the "daylight" bulb is not delightful.  The light is too dim.  I've done the things suggested by instructions and other users, to no success.  I must agree that, for the price, this product should have better sound and quality.  That leaves us with "Great idea, lousy execution!

WARNING:  THIS SYSTEM COULD BE HARMFUL TO YOUR HEALTH AND HAPPINESS and walls.
1.)  The danged clippy thingy is very difficult to snap on to the HOT, damp, roller, so it is very easy to burn fingers while trying to manipulate it. 
2.) This is very frustrating, and made this reviewer want to throw roller and clippy thingy at the wall.
3.) The Sadistic designer only made ONE WAY for the You-can't-put-a-square-peg-in-a-round-hole variously sized rollers to be replaced in the unit after use.  This puzzle remains unsolved by this reviewer. 
4.) This is very frustrating, and made this reviewer want to throw the whole danged unit, rollers and clippy thingies included, at the wall.
5.) Even if you only use a few of the rollers on your hair, you have to take them ALL OUT of the unit - (the better to play the afore-mentioned puzzle game, my dear) to dump the unused water out of the unit prior to storage.
6.) This is very frustrating, and made this reviewer want to throw the whole danged water-filled unit, rollers and clippy thingies included, at the wall.

The chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch, however, it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate.  
The 1 star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack.  I had intended to use it as a cold mask only.

My rheumatologist recommended that I try a wax bath product for the osteoarthritis in my thumbs.  The cartiledge in the left thumb is all but gone, with the right thumb being in better shape.  The wax bath did not eliminate or ease the pain in either thumb, but did greatly improved the skin on both hands.  I continue to use it just for the dry skin on my hands, and am pleased with the results.  It's possible that this product would have worked better for me if I'd used it earlier, before my thumbs got so bad.  I plan to use the wax bath for the pain from inflammation in my feet, due to rheumatoid arthritis.  I did have to turn down the heat due to a lifelong and extreme sensitivity to heat in my hands, and this is probably why the wax doen't stay warm for longer than 10 - 12 minutes, even when wrapped in the plastic bags and then in a towel.  The initial loading of wax has lasted a long time, so I don't recommend purchasing more than 2 or 3 pounds of wax at a time

I had great results with this product with the first use.  However, when I used it the second time, the triangular pad lost all of its abrasive surface, leaving me with a smooth, useless triangle.  I replaced the triangle, thinking I had a "dud", but had the same thing happen with the second pad.  The cream will work without the pad, but not as effectively.  If the manufacturer can come up with a pad that has a more permanent surface, they will have a winner with this product.  On a positive note, I love the facial product

This item was recommended in a magazine article for calluses on your feet, so I bought this specifically for that use. I used the triangular pumice attachment only.I was under the impression that the attachment would rotate,but in general it's just a vibrating(2 levels) machine with attachments that you move around your body manually. The vibrations weren't intense enough to make any difference. The actual machine has no function. The body resurfacing cream which has little scrubbing crystals was ok , but can easily be used without this machine

I explected the microdermabrasion head to rotate, but instead it vibrates very strongly in your hand.  My hands are still buzzing from the night before when I used this product.

I would not recommend this product to anyone else, I loved the crystals cream.

I decided to try the caffeine free Mega-T because I quit caffeine a couple years ago and didn't want a diet supplement with caffeine.  I only needed to lose 10 pounds.  Took as directed for 1 week.  Also followed the diet and exercise program per the enclosed pamphlet.  After 1 week, to my dismay, I actually gained 3 pounds!  I contacted CCA Industries, the company that makes Mega-T, and they promptly informed me that they have a 30 day guarantee and to return them, along with my receipt, for a refund.  I shipped them back yesterday.  I gave a 2 star rating because of CCA Industries' customer service

The bath seat was easy to put together and satisfactory to use. But some of the metal hardware that was provided for use in assembling the seat was not rust-proof, and rusted after several weeks of use. It makes no sense to make a product used under water that contains metal parts that are not rust-proof.

The photo of this product is extremely beautiful and its supposed functions are very attractive, so I bought it even though the existing reviews are mostly negative. 

Well, the reviews are right. This product arrived unassembled. I stared at the obscure instruction and the parts that does not seem to be able to hold in any way for a good couple of minutes, and decided this is not for me. And by the way, without the beautiful blue light showing on the photo, this thing looks like a lifeless vase made of pale glass. 

As I re-pack this thing back, I noticed that it has actually been opened and re-sealed before. That means someone bought it and decided to return it as well. That says a lot about this product.

These hair topia pills are nothing but garbage! Pure nonsense! Trust me, I know this because I used to buy them.  I first bought these pills last year in June 2005 after hair formula 37's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage. Well, these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned, and had promised also change dry and brittle hair into long and healthy, and it did absolute NOTHING. I said to myself, like hair formula 37, that maybe I just need to give this more time, so I bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all. This product might just work for others, which it has, but it certainly didn't work for me. I must admit that I brought this on myself, as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway, and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like Giant or even hair vitamins in the damn Dollar Store! Thus, I am here to warn others not to waste their precious money. And if you are going to, please don't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com.

I thought these wipes would be a handy solution for the office or situations where I don't want to carry around a bottle and a microfiber cloth.  But contrary to what's promised on the package the wipes left big watermarks on lenses, which ended up dirtier than they started.

The wipes work okay on a computer screen, though

They have to be lubricated several times during a hair cut.  My hair is very short and this is unusual.  If you do not go over every area of your head at least 5 times you will have tiny haris sticking out.  I spent more on these clippers thinking they would be better.  I would have been better buying a cheap pair at Walmart, which I normally do

This is no doubt the worse product I have ever purchased from Amazon.  I would return it or perhaps I should throw in the trash.
The weight varies if you step on it within a 10 minute interval enormously.  It is horrible.

OK, it does get hot quickly.  But only when I can get it to turn on.  After about 6 months, the connection to the power switch became loose.  Now I have a hard time getting it to turn on.  I'm about to buy a different iron with a different type of switch

At first, I thought this product was great, and I used it for a few days. Then, I noticed that my face was getting red and swollen. Now, I look all deformed. I am really upset!! The acid ate away at my face and I am still waiting for my face to heal. I called Neutrogena and they said it is probably an allergic reaction. 



March 23, 2007, Update: After the swelling on my face went down, my whole body started itching, and I had to go see two different doctors. The internist said that it got into my system, and gave me two strong prescriptions to get it out of my system. I took the medication for over 2 weeks, and used Cortizone 10 several times a day to relieve the itching. My arms and legs are all scared. There are still marks now even though my arms and legs have healed. This was the worst product that I have ever used, and I don't even have sensitive skin. I never had a problem with a product ever!! I was very careful when I used Rapid Clear. It never got in my eyes, nose, or mouth. I used it once a day for a week until my face swelled up and turned all red. I looked like the character on Mask. Horrifying!!! I will never ever buy another dangerous product from Neutrogena, again!!!! I will tell everyone what happened to me!!! The funny thing is..... one person that I told this to, who also saw my swollen face,.... she said this exact thing happened to her with another Neutrogena product. So, I know it's not just me! What the heck is Neutrogena putting in their products?

I have to say i am disappointed, Having used a trimmer from wahl with same model number 9916,  which i felt gave me a good trim, i immediately sought out to buy same model off amazon. 

the one i received was much cheaper in quality. The plastic guide IS cheap junk which felt like it would break eventually, which it did within 3 weeks from being dropped. The guide shattered. There is no replacement for the 5-position guide for the 9916 I can find.

Now i am torn between buying another of these and treating it like a precious heirloom, or finding a razor that can survive real world use.

On the plus side, the battery life on this razor is incredible.

Don't buy this product. I went through two units with the same problem. The trimmer is made of cheap plastic with plastic tabs to snap onto to the blade. Within less than one week the tabs broke and the trimmer would no longer stay attached. Further the base/stand is just a lightweight piece of junk that does not properly hold the handle and accessories - very poorly designed, Wahl should be embararssed. 
It did a nice job of trimming my beard but the attachments are so awkward to install and remove, the base practically useless and the trimmer tabs break so easily that I would have given it no stars if possible. 
The fact that I returned one unit only to get a second that broke within a week makes me wonder what good the two year warranty is worth

Tried this product for 2 weeks; it did improve the clarity and softness, but I found the product to be too scratchy and it did not rinse off well, seemed to have a sticky feel.  Since then, I found a wonderful microdermabrasion product called Microdermx by Nikkel Holistic Skincare. This product performs like magic; it is not too scratchy and I can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like I've been slapped with a wire brush.  I can do the treatment 2-3x's a week, (like your supposed to) but I also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before. It is a magical product.

This straightener has been one of the worst I have ever used. It didn't straighten at all. I had to go over sections of my hair more than 10 times to get it at least semi straight. It did not stay straight either.&#60;br /&#62;

The only thing good about this item is that it is cheap. It was able to somewhat straighten my incredibly curly, thick hair but that was only after going over the same sections of hair numerous times. In the end my hair would still come out somewhat curled, frizzy and puffy. This straightener is somewhat heavy to hold and the plates do not get hot enough

This straightener is great for thin hair... but not for thick. I myself have very thick hair and this straightener usually leaves my hair looking frizzy and very poofy. The best hair straighteners out there are about 1&quot; thick or less and they normally have glass plates. So if you have thick hair, spend a little more money on something with a lot more quality

While Bumble and Bumble used to be one of my favorite lines of hair care products, this conditioner (and I might add shampoo by the same name) was a real disappointment. 

Using it left no softening or conditioning effect and there wasn't even a pleasant scent. Don't know where Bumble fumbled but they certainly fouled up on this one. I'm saving my $$$$$ for Lush and Frederic Fekkai

This product almost had me going to the ER. I felt a little flush so I used this monitor to check my blood pressure. It was 151/98. A second check showed 148/100. I then really started feeling flush as a wave of burning flushed my body. My wife an RN said calm down, breath deeply. I went over to my Rottweiler and started hugging and petting her. After about 10 min. I felt the flushness go away but the blood pressure showed 162/99. I made a Dr's appointment and brought the machine with me. In his office where my pressure always is elevated when he 1st takes it, I used the machine in front of him and my pressure was 153/107. I really got nervous. He took it with his machine and it was 140/82. You won't believe the relief. He took it again with another machine and it had come down to 135/80. I'd like to return the machine for a non-digital one. I've seen this before with a digital machine from a different company

This device worked about 80% of the time on myself and only about 10% of the time on my father.  Unfortunately, it was a Christmas gift for him and not for me.  
 We ended up getting a self inflating one at Circuit City that seems to be working just fine.
 It IS possible that the problem lies with him - possible faint heartbeat or high blood pressure but it is odd that the one at CC worked just fine

My biggest issue with this shaker is that it doesn't seal properly around the threaded part of the cap. Even if I really tighten it up, I still get a small leak when I shake it. Also, the cap for the mouthpiece pops off pretty easy. But overall it gets the job done, and having fluid graduations on the side are nice

It does let you shake and mix up the protein well. But no matter how tightly you screw the cap on liquid gets all around the edge and in the threads. Then as soon as you put it down it all runs down the sides and leaks everywhere. It's a horribly cheap and leaky design. I would look elsewhere or just be prepared with a lot of paper towels every time you use it. (and if you find a good one that doesn't leak please post the info here and let me know). Thanks

I bought this product b/c I can't stand the feeling of hair/stubble on my legs. I got sick of taking 20 minutes every other day to shave. This product indicated I could remove hair in about the same amount of time, but that it would last much longer than shaving. I purchased it and waited a week to receive it. Once I received it, I spent 40 minutes using it. In this time, I could have shaved both legs, both underarms, and my bikini line twice. Using this product, I was not even done with one leg. I went over the leg numerous times over that 40 minute period, and it did not remove a single hair. I pressed lightly, I pressed hard, I did everything but stand on my head and twirl my feet while rubbing my stomach, and nothing made this product work as indicated. Others may have had luck with it, but I did not. I was not impressed and I would not recommend it to anyone.

This product is great at exfoliating, not so great at hair removal.  Your skin will be silky smooth, but still have hair.  The hair that is removed doesn't stay gone long.  And it's tricky to maneuver into the curvier parts of your body.  It will definitely have to be used in conjunction with another product.

Beware! This thing, even if you try to be careful to be light on the pressure, as well as not keep it in one spot, it took the top layer of skin off! My poor legs were in pain from my jeans rubbing up against them at work. Ow! I had to wrap them up in long cloth bandages till the skin healed. And what's worse, it didn't take out all the hair.... I could still see some hair here and there it missed, and I thought I got it all. I returned it immediately and got a refund on my money. Never again.... I'll stick to my good ol' electric razor instead....

I received this as a Christmas gift and thought, "Why not... I'll try it."  The woman who bought the gift for me also has one and told me NOT TO APPLY ANY PRESSURE when using the device.  As a redhead, I have extremely sensitive, thin skin so I followed her advice very carefully.  I did not apply any pressure what-so-ever, and didn't keep the device in one area for too long.  The result..... worse than any sunburn I've ever had!  My legs are burned in various areas, as the product sanded off the first layer of my skin!  The skin hardened and has begun to crack in the burned areas.  I'm a little concerned and think I should call my physician, as the condition is extremely painful.  Worst of all, the hair grew back immediately the next day and I had to shave the areas that were not burned.  This is a terrible, dangerous product!

I suspect that the phrase mentioned in the title of my review (which I saw in the description of the product) was Amazon's idea since most (if not all) of the label information is easily found on Nature Made's own website  www.NatureMade.com.  

There you will find that several of the components are synthetic (not necessarily bad, but I like to know), and also that Amazon is near the top in selling price of the 6 listed online retailers for this particular product.  

Ain't it just amazing what the web can teach you?   Thanks Amazon! :)

I like this hairdryer.. when it works! It has broken twice on me.. the first time it starting spitting out sparks so I sent it back.. they sent me a new one (of course I had to get a temporary one because it took a while to get it back) and now it only works on low, the high is broken.. I am going to throw it out and get a different brand.. Not impressed!

Worked well five times. Then it slowed down and made cutting more difficult despite removing head and running water through it to clean, as per instructions. Then it would run before cutting, but upon trying to edge trim my moustache, it would stop immediately, as if a single hair could jam it. Removing head, as required for cleaning, showed that bottom part with its drive motor worked fine, with a rotating metal stub that fit loosely into a poorly made plastic part that moved the blade. It appears that this plastic part's stability, shape and alignment changed after a few uses allowing hairs to jam its movement. A poor design that shouldn't have used plastic. Do not bu

I ordered this product on June 7th 2006, today is July 11th 2006, and I still have not received it.  I have cancelled my order because it is a lot faster to drive to the story to purchase it, than to wait over a month for it to show up.  I'm really not happy with the turn around time for the Tide HE Detergent.

Depending on how I shifted my weight--even just slightly--the scale read different amounts.   This is normal when the difference is small.  But the difference was up to 20 pounds!  There was no way to know how much I really weighed! I called Amazon right away to send it back...

Like everyone else has said - the controls on this dryer suck! If your fingers are at all wet or greasy from product, it is a struggle to flip the switches. I don't know if the ionic feature did anything or not. I suppose I'll know once I compare it to the replacement I'm about to buy. 

I had the dryer for about a year...and now it's gone. As I was drying my hair last week I noticed sparks shooting out of the nozzle! Yikes. I cleaned out the filter and the sparks stopped. It lasted maybe 3 more uses before it just went dead. No smoke, no fires, just nothing. I expect a longer life from a simple appliance like this. Back to Target I go..

I was pretty excited to try an ION hairdryer. I got this one because I liked the idea of being able to 'control' the amount of ions coming out. 

My hair DID seem a little shinier after using it (the only reason I gave it two stars and not one) but my hair felt a little drier. Almost straw-ish...it never felt like that with my old drier. 

Also the buttons really are hard to switch...all of them! I read another review that said that and I thought well how bad can it be? I dry my hair with a round brush in my right hand and the dryer in the left. I turn the dryer on and off during different times while I am doing my hair. With this dryer I could NOT turn the on/off switch with my left hand. I had to put down my brush and use both hands. I could not believe how hard it was to switch! This was the main deciding factor in returning the dryer, it was SO frustrating not to be able to switch it easily with a flick of your thumb. Not to mention made me feel like a big wussy!!!

The speed setting only has two settings, low and high. The low setting was way too low and the high setting was way too high. A middle ground would have been nice. 

Lastly, the dryer smelled a little weird. Granted, I only had it two days before I returned it, so the smell might eventually disappear. But it wasn't your normal 'new hairdryer, hot plastic' smell. It was almost a slight mildew smell. Yuk.

So, I would NOT recommend getting it. I exchanged it for the Vidal Sassoon ion sensor dryer. That seems to be working better. The low speed setting is perfect. The smell is normal 'new dryer' smell so far. The buttons are EASY to push!!!!  The sensor (it automatically turns off when you pur it down) is a little off, it takes a while to turn off. But all in all I like it. And it also DOES make my hair shiny and DOES NOT make it feel drier or like straw!

After some research online, I decided to purchase this dryer because it had all the qualities I was looking for in a lightweight, compact model. It worked great while it lasted, but unfortunately it died 6 months after purchasing it. One day it worked, and the next day it started smoking and sparking!!

I got this product to help me sleep and it did NOT work for me.  I used to take some pain killer/sleep aid made by Members Mark and that worked great, but I no longer need the pain killer.  I bought this and have tried it 3 times now, and I can't quite explain it but it did not make me tired.  It made me feel relaxed and more of a false tired, plus it made my sleepless leg syndrome act up all three times I used it.  Not only did it not make me drowsy, I couldn't sleep and I woke up several times during the night.  I think I would have done better without it.  But everyone reacts to drugs differently, so try at your own risk

I purchased this product in an attempt to help out with jet-lag and it worked really well.  I've used it a few times since and find it doesn't send me to sleep any quicker than usual, but I don't tend to wake up through the night if I've taken it. It's obviously not something you'd want to rely on all the time, but very its handy as a occasional aid if you're having a bad run of nights. Doesn't make you feel hung-over the next day, either. Sadly, I can't buy any more because Australia doesn't recognise the product. I don't know why, because as far as I can make out its active ingredient is good old-fashioned Benadryl.

I really like the Crane humidifiers for children, my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at night for quite some time.  It occasionally glugs but the most part is very quiet.  So I was confident that the apple shape my elder daughter chose would be just as good.  I was surprised when it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller than I had expected and the design of the base which controled the water flow was different.  Still we started to use it and quickly discovered that it didn't detect the water level accurately and frequently turned itself off.  This may be a fault with the one I received and so I have sent it back, or it may be a design flaw with this shape.  I have just received the soccer ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the water cannister is more like a sphere.  So although I haven't had chance to use it I am more hopeful of success.
It is important to empty these humidifiers regularly and clean them, I forgot for a few days and was horrified at the build up of slimy stuff and the smell of mould in such a short time

I bought this Apple humidifier in early November. It stopped working soon at the first time I used it. I later found out that there was no water exchange unless you shake it or move it so that it might continue to work for a while and then stopped again. You have to repeat the above steps in order to keep it working. I contacted the manufacturer and got replacement. However, the new one has the same problem, and what's worse, it leaks!! I talked to the manufacturer again, but they didn't think there should be such problem and refused to do anything else. Now I have to keep this defected machine and have no idea what to do

we received it with broken cover. It didn't work properly and stopped running every hour. We tried different ways to make it run, but nothing worked. We've returned it. It's just waste of money.
On the other hand the COW-humidifier which we bought at the same time is fine and running well. No complaints

I got this humidifer for my daughter's bedroom.  She loved the big apple but it only ran for about one hour at a time, then automatically shut off.  Tried all the troubleshooting suggestions to no avail.  I had to return it.  HOWEVER, I did buy the penguin shape for my 2nd daughter's room and that one works great.

This shaver only works on short or fine hair. If your hair is long (more than 1/4 inch) or coarse, it just skips over the hair and doesn't do anything. I've thrown it away and gone back to disposable razors

I've read a lot of reviews on this product. It obviously works for some people, but be aware it doesn't work for everyone. Me being one of the latter. I've taken it twice and both times it did nothing. First time I took it before I left for work. The drive to work I was yawning and about to fall asleep. I didn't get 5 minutes of energy let alone 5 hours. Second time I took it was about 15 minutes ago. Still nothing. I was feeling sleepy and still am. My Mom, on the other hand, says it makes her energetic as hell. It might work for you. It might not, but 5 dollars (2 pack was all they had) is a lot to waste to find out.

Very disappointing.  The shower head itself is massive - the size of a small dinner plate.  It is attached to a long hose which is so flexible it can't support the weight of the head when the shower is in use.  Predictably, when you turn on the shower, the head drops groundward, spewing water in a horizontal spray.  Installs easily, but save your money

Of course it works great - for as long as it works. After some time, my unit develped a leak. Unlike better showerheads, the part connecting the head to the hose is assembled in two pieces that separate after time, causing the seals to not set properly, resulting in the kind of leak mine developed. Unless you want to replace your showerhead every couple of years, I'd stay away fom this model. And good luck navigating Watrepik's website to get any help

I bought this item for my wife exactly four months ago (9-15-06) and she said it was working well for most of the four months.  She had concerns because the electrical cord which attachs to the unit rotates and when it rotated to certain angles, the heat would turn off (as indicated by the green light which is either off, flickers or solid).  As she used it, the problem became more and more frequent.  Now, the unit will not work unless it is at one point and at a certain angle (which I guess allows electricity to go to the unit).  I tried taping it to that location but the cord also has to stay at that certain angle which is impossible to maintain when using the iron.  This is not very good for such an expensive item which gets alot of twisting and turning use and should have the highest materials and workmanship to prevent electrical.  My wife admits that like anyone the unit has been dropped, but that should not cause an electrical cord problem.  Dropping the iron risks breaking the two flat iron ceramic plates, which are still perfectly intact.  The problem is that because of the cord, and the way a flat iron is used, there is alot of cord twisting.  For what is advertised as a "professional" device and at a cost which only a professional would normally purchase, we cannot believe that this could be used in a "professional" environment.  My wife only uses it six or seven times a week, not six or seven times a day like in a salon.  We highly recommend that you STAY AWAY from this product.

Unfortunately Total Block did not work well with my rosacea sensitive skin. It caused my skin to become very red and irritated by the end of the day. I don't doubt this is an excellent sunblock, just not for my rosacea sensitive skin. I use it now on my arms with no problems. 
I do feel it is very expensive for so little product so will not repurchase

Let me start by saying I think the regular Guru energy drink is the best on the market. I only wish I could say the same about GURU Lite. There is nothing positive about this drink. It is awful! I was very excited about trying the Lite version but after my first can the rest went straight into the garbage. You might as well take a Ginseng or Ginkgo Biloba capsule open it and pour it straight into your mouth. If you are big fan of the regular Guru stay with it and don't waste your money on their Lite version.

I bought this hoping this will be better than shaving and last longer, but its not good, first of all it doesn't remove all the hair and second its very very painful and very very slow, if you have lots of free time to spend shaving the most painful way posible (I have done wax and wax doesn't hurt compare to this) then this is your product.

Other bad thing it produces ingrown hair THE horror!

I have been trying to suppress my appetite for awhile. I took TrimSpa 32 and I think that it did better than this product. I have been taking it for a week, and along with that, I have been substituting a nutrition shake for breakfast and a salad for lunch, plus working out. Dinners are healthy about 5 days out of the week.  I've noticed NO change.  I am taking these to be able to eat significantly less and still work out.  I'm very hungry before lunch and when I get home I have to take a nap and can't work out until later in the evening. I really have noticed no change at all in my appetite or my energy level, which is really unfortunate

This razor is not worth the money. It did shave pretty well for a few months, but the rubber strips wear out really quickly. And, even though the "cleaning option" with the fluid seems like a great idea... it does not work very well... the razor was never clean... and refilling the fluid is just a pain... I would not recommend this razor

This product does not work if you have soft blonde hair.  My hair is not coarse and this razor just glided right over top with out cutting a thing.  It's comfortable to hold and seems like it is made well, but it is definatly not for those of us with soft hair.

I bought this shaver last September, and at that point I agreed with the other reviewers. It delivered a nick-free shave and was quick and painless to use. This past May, it stopped being able to re-charge and just died completely. I only used the recommended cleaning solution, changed it according to the instructions, and cleaned it after every use. I sent the shaver back to Remington, they were very nice and sent a new replacement shaver after a few weeks. It worked wonderfully, for about 2 months when the same problem occurred again! I'm sending it back again and hoping for a refund this time, it isn't worth my time and money to go to the post office every few months to return yet another defective shaver!

The concept is cute, although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them, but the main problem is that they give you hat hair, compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head.  Regular glasses go in between the hairs, so everything fluffs out.

If you never take off your reading glasses, have a buzz cut, are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head (but be careful of buns), the clic connect reader may be fine for you.  Otherwise, conventional glasses are a better bet

   I was attempting to order Aveda Brilliant Anti-Humectant Pomade, but received Aveda Brilliant Humectant Pomade. The packaging is so similiar. Did not realize until I opened product that I had the wrong item. Either you sent the wrong item or I inadverantly ordered the wrong one because of packaging. I was being very careful to follow every word... so I wonder. ... does Aveda srill make the anti-Humectant Pomade. I am stuck with the wrong item now that I opened the jar. At any rate, I am not a happy customer with a product that will not meet my needs plus I am minus the $22.53 amount spent

conair just really does not make great hair straighteners. i bought the full size one before, and without warning it just quit working after a 2 months. i have a revlon full-size one now (which works GREAT). i recently got my hair cut short, so i decided to go buy a cheap small one to reach the short hair in the back. turn the turbo on, blast it up to the highest temperature, and it still is not even half as hot as my revlon one thats turned on minimum. i have really thin hair, and its not even curly it just gets wavy sometimes. this thing cant even straighten that much

I bought this iron for my teen daughters - actually I bought it twice, since I didn't have much choice where I was shopping.  Both times it died.  The first iron lasted about 6 months, and the second lasted 2 weeks!  Just dies, no warning.  My girls are begging me to buy them a decent straightener that is not a Conair!  I am going to invest in a better one this time and am doing a lot of research

Babyliss Pro Instant Heat 5 Jumbo Roller Hairsetter comes in a compact, useful size.  However, the rollers take a long time to heat up. Even if left plugged in for a half-hour, they do not reach a high enough temperature to effectively curl thick hair.  I would not recommend this product

The first few days worked great.  I could not finish eating anything, I was full with very little to eat but after a few days the effect wore off.  I work out daily, count carlories and drink at least 74 ounces of water a day.  I did notice a slight difference in my nails and never experienced jitters but that was it.  I did not lose any weight what so ever.  I think this may be good if you want to have a bit more energy but don't expect any weight lost.

I made the mistake of buying this light to treat my acne without first talking to my dermatologist about it.  After just using it three times my acne became more out of control than it had in years--my face broke out in places it had never broken out before.  It took me two months of using medication from my doctor to get my acne under control. I would not recommend using this device unless a doctor says it would work for you

The drywalls in my house apparently have some insulation blown into them, and I could not get the hooks to work.  I finally did get one  in place and hung a medium large picture on it, and it failed.  Far short of the maximum weight on the package.   In all fariness the walls were not the right kind of walls and I think whey would work fine for small and medium pics.  The laser tool that was included is neat and I used it for all of my pictures, which I had to hang with other hardware

The Sharper Image offers a better product which I have been using for about a year but I wanted to try the Conair for a little more "heat." I shaved with the HGM 1 and felt pretty good about it. I returned about an hour later and it had emptied an ENTIRE can of Edge Gel (unplugged) over the bathroom counter top. Go with the Sharper Image product with this little hint: Ignore the instructions regarding the one minute warm-up and let it warm up for about 4-5 minutes and you will get a decently hot lather

This isn't what I thought it would be.  The instructions are unclear, so I had to refer to the box to guess at how to install it.  I finally figured it out after about 10 minutes of fiddling with it.  You have push down on the top to get more than a tiny bit of gel out - so it takes two hands. That means that once you put gel on your face, you get gel on the machine. I set mine machine to the hottest setting for it to feel warm. This must be a safety thing, but I can't imagine what the lower settings are for.  The gel cools extremely fast, so by the time you apply it to your face, only the gel where you first apply it feels warm.  I had the same machine for foam and that worked a lot better, but I don't use foam shaving creme anymore.  Once I use up this can of gel, the Hot Gel Machine gets retired.

If you're interested in the Chrome model to match your stainless steel appliances be prepared to constantly polish it due to the water spots. My friend owns one and at first I was envious, but now I rather be less fashionable than freak out over the visible water spots. This model has the same shape as the Riviera and as I stated in my other review althought it is ergonomic, the Riviera collects algae on the bottom of the pitcher so I would be skeptical in buying this one. 

The only reason I gave it two stars because it ultimately looks cool but you can't avoid the water spots and it may be algae friendly.

I don't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose. I don't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all; as I said I don't have a huge melon like Mike Myers's brother in "So I Married an Axe Murderer". The idea/concept is great but...I'll probably return them. Unfortunate because I was really looking forward to using them. People with REALLY big heads, caveat emptor

Choose the Crane penguin or soccer ball humidifiers instead

I really like the Crane humidifiers for children, my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at night for quite some time.  It occasionally glugs but the most part is very quiet.  So I was confident that the apple shape my elder daughter chose would be just as good.  I was surprised when it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller than I had expected and the design of the base which controled the water flow was different.  Still we started to use it and quickly discovered that it didn't detect the water level accurately and frequently turned itself off.  This may be a fault with the one I received and so I have sent it back, or it may be a design flaw with this shape.  I have just received the soccer ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the water cannister is more like a sphere.  So although I haven't had chance to use it I am more hopeful of success.
It is important to empty these humidifiers regularly and clean them, I forgot for a few days and was horrified at the build up of slimy stuff and the smell of mould in such a short time

I purchased this orange humidifer and promptly returned it. I already have the penguin which is also by this company...and that one worked perfectly. I don't know if it is because of the design...but this one shuts off after about ten minutes of running. You have to constantly shake it to get it going again. Obviously a manufacturer error. I must say it is completely adorable and asthetically a complete pleasure to look at. My kids wanted me to keep it because it was that cute. But, it just didn't work

I bought this Apple humidifier in early November. It stopped working soon at the first time I used it. I later found out that there was no water exchange unless you shake it or move it so that it might continue to work for a while and then stopped again. You have to repeat the above steps in order to keep it working. I contacted the manufacturer and got replacement. However, the new one has the same problem, and what's worse, it leaks!! I talked to the manufacturer again, but they didn't think there should be such problem and refused to do anything else. Now I have to keep this defected machine and have no idea what to do

I got this humidifer for my daughter's bedroom.  She loved the big apple but it only ran for about one hour at a time, then automatically shut off.  Tried all the troubleshooting suggestions to no avail.  I had to return it.  HOWEVER, I did buy the penguin shape for my 2nd daughter's room and that one works great.

I was disappointed getting this product because I've read the previous reviews and the majority have written positive feedback on this hair iron.  I actually prefer the cheaper Conair's ceremanic irons w/o the wet on/off feature over this one.  It doesn't clamp down well on my hair (I've got thick frizzy hair).  The results for me aren't that great, it straightens my hair a little but it's still frizzy.  It's lightweight which is nice.  I don't care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair.  I definitely prefer other models over this one.

I've used the same straightener for the past four years and have always been able to get my naturally curly hair perfectly straight.  This past Christmas though I got the Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Straightener as a gift and decided to try it out.  Not only did it not work for anything, it pulled my hair and broke it at every pass.  Also, it took more than twice as long as my normal straightener.  Needless to say, I'll be taking this back for an exchange.

I suggest the normal flat panel straightener for anyone with naturally curly hair

As others experienced, both packs each had two dead batteries in them. I am even using the Juice Family Charger, so it isn't a brand problem.  The packaging was a little beat up as well as if they were sitting around for a long time.  Sort of dirty. Also purchased D batteries as well and that packaging was worse.  

Hard to knock the fact they are made in China because let's admit it, pretty much everything you buy is made in China. The problem is the poor quality control from the company Juice Battery themselves.  These are actually ok batteries if they work, but not worth the price especially when taking the chance on whether they will arrive beat up or DOA.

Even though still most likely made in China, stick to the main well-known brands insread of this junk

Original purchase had two dead batteries, then a replacement set had the same results , it's as if they were bundling two dead batteries with every order. But the bottom line says it all in fine print on the back down low "MADE IN CHINA".

This thing comes with lots of attachments, of which I regularly used only 2. The vibrating cuticle pusher is silly. As far as all those round discs, it's hard to explain the physics of this, but suffice it to say that since it's a rotating circle, you can only use half of it at a time or you'll experience a bump-bump-bump. The thing rotates at such a speed (even the lowest of the two speeds) that even leaving on your toe or finger for a moment or two can create a burning sensation. 

What I did use was the smallest pointed attachment, which I used to lightly go around my nail close to the cuticle. This was good for when you're wearing clear nail polish and your nails are starting to grow out. You can lightly buff down that ridge of polish. Same goes for the edge where acrylic meets the natural nail. 

The other attachment I used, though less frequently, is the bigger cone-shaped one (kind of looks like the shape of a foam ear plug). That I used to lightly go over my largest toenails to thin them down since I have trouble with ingrown toenails. Again, it's a challenge not to create burn when doing so. 

The nail dryer thing is silly and useless. If you manage to cram your hand into that little scoop without smudging the polish, it doesn't do much anyway to dry your nails any faster than just letting them set. Buy a little fan like they use in the shops if you want faster drying time. This thing isn't gonna do it. 

Other folks mentioned this thing ruined their nails. It's likely because they tried to use all of the attachments (which you'd think you should be able to do, right?). Much regular buffing on your nail thins it down and weakens it too much. The bump-bump-bump of the round attachments likely doesn't help, either. 

A couple times I used this for acrylic nails. I have a tendency to wear acrylic nails a few weeks and then hate them and want them removed---and I'm no longer willing to subject myself to the soak-and-pry method done in the nail salons. So the alternative was soak at home, or just trim down myself and then thin them to a more natural curved shape until the rest of the acrylic grew out. However, I mention I did this only a couple times. That's because apparently acrylics are a bit too much of a challenge for this little "Deluxe Manicure System." After sounding like it was ailing while it filed down the length of 2 acrylic nails, it gave a little bzz and then died. I waited a while to see if maybe it overheated. I tried other outlets. Nope, dead. 

So I'd pronounce this unfit for natural or acrylic nails. If you want something of quality for acrylic nails, invest in the Dremel tools that the salons use (just be sure to get one with a low RPM or foot pedal attachment). If you want something of quality for natural nails, go to the drug store and get some sandpaper nail files, a rectangular buffer, and a cuticle pusher. Sometimes the best solution is the simplest.

I agree with the reviews from the other reviewers.  It basically ruined my nails the first time I used it.  However what I did discover is that this is an excellent products for keeping my dogs claws trimmed.  After trimming their claws you often get rough edges.  I now use this manicure kit to smooth the edges and keep their claws short.  They don't seem to mind it becuase it is very quiet.  I must state that I will never again use this product for my own nails

I was very eager to use this product.  I had all sorts of various files and clippers to keep up with and I thought this would be a great replacement.  I was a little disappointed when I had to let the hand set charge for over 18 hours before I could get full power.  My disappointment increased when the cheap plastic attachments started breaking after just a few uses.  We can not use the nail filing disks because they will cause a friction pain if you use them at the wrong angle.  I had big hopes for this product but all I got was a big disappoinment

This Flat Iron Combo Curler is not worth the money that I spent for it.  First of all it does not get hot enough to straighten my hair.  Although I must admit that my hair is very thick and wiry.  If anyones hair is the least bit thick it will not work.  I wish I had spent more and got the Sedu since it had very good reviews.  Now I have to start over and buy a new one because this iron cannot be returned if it has been opened.  Now, tell me how anyone would know if it works or not if it is not opened and used.  "DUH"

I've used GHDs and even though they're pricier they are worth every penny. After using the Hai Stick just one time, I had terrible split ends, and the stick did not 'glide' over my hair in the same way but seemed to tear. Terrible! I think I'll upgrade

I bought this product from the Discovery Channel Store and I really want to love it, but all of the green colored lights stopped working a couple weeks after I bought it.  I returned to the store where I was given a new fountain, but the same exact thing happened to the new one just a couple weeks later.  The mister still works well, but the LED lights are unpredictable at best

First of all I was very disappointed when I received my Waterpik CF-203C Cascadia showerhead.  It is all plastic!  I do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs.  I thought when I oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal.  Sedondly, even with the head made of plastic, the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it.  We could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall.  We installed it repeatedly, following each step of the instructions every time, thinking we were missing something.  I eventually returned the showerhead to Amazon

The pressure on the rain setting is so low you have to keep it on the concentrated spray to really wash the soap out.  Switching between the two causes a cold stream to come out for a second or two till it clears.  Also it is not sturdy - when the showerhead is moved to a higher position it does not stay and falls back down to the lower position.  I will be returning mine

I had this model, or at least it looked the same, for a few years and it worked exceptionally well.  It finally broke down recently and I thought I was lucky enough to find it again, but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all.  Actually, it is virtually useless as it only partially gets the job done, which, of course is like not having it done at all

The straightener works ok. It straightens my hair better when it is dry. I have very course hair. I still had to blow dry it to get it to straighten out, and go over it a few times to really make it straight. The remington is to thick, so you can not style the hair at all with it. The worst part about this particular straightener is when I leave it plugged in and have it shut off it keeps making a beeping sound?? I have to unplug it to make it stop. I just bought a chai straightner for about three times the cost of this, it is only 1 inch thick so it styles the hair very nice, but it straightens my hair the same as the remington. I have only had it a few weeks, so I am intrested to see if the chai causes less damage as it claims then other straighteners

I am a reviewer and I was checking out this 'sleep aid' when it struck me as strange that almost every review for this product sounds like a promotion of the product, not a review, AND note that the reviewers have only one review (click on their 'see all my reviews').  Beware of this shoddy marketing ploy.
  
This 'crud' alone merits my one star rating.  Amazon needs to censor these reviews

Now I try to limit my caffeine intake to the bare minimum, like in tea.  I do not drink coffee.  So when I took Stacker 3 (just ONE PILL) I was jittery and could not fall asleep.  I stayed wide awake the whole night and through the day.  I felt nauseus too.  Now this was probably because I don't drink coffee or anything that has a lot of caffeine in it, but I don't recommend Stacker 3 anyway

This product must work for some people but obviously not for everyone. I started this 1 month ago, using it as directed with normal diet & regular exercise, & I've gained 8 pounds! On the up side, the price was low ordering thru Amazon, so I would recommend if you're really interested go ahead & try it, maybe it will work for you

Absolutely the worst cream ever! After about a week of using it, my skin turned very red and then gray/brown! I developed severe wrinkling and my skin became rubbery and loose. I went to a dermatologist who did a biopsy and said that I had developed elastolytic granulomas over the area where the cream was put - the elastin in those areas was destoyed and there was a scarring like pattern of collagen. The normal architecture of the dermal/epidermal junction was also lost - causing melanin from the epidermis to fall into the dermis - basically causing PERMANENT discoloration! Dont listen to the false hype on the net - that hype is coming from people trying to make money off this stuff - take the advice of someone who has actually USED this product - copper peptide products are NOT good for your skin

These CliC glasses are a great idea... I first saw them on CSI-NY, and sought them out, but they are not made big enough... they worked fine as long as I was looking down, but as soon as I turned my head level, or looking up, the glasses would "pop" apart.  I had purchased two pair, and returned them both

Bought two of these. One as a gift and one for myself. Luckily I tried mine out before I gave the other away. This thing just vibrates. NO MASSAGE AT ALL!! After 30 seconds you get nausea...its not worth 23.99...its a piece of junk. Trust me you are not getting a bargain. I guess you pay for what you get, but in this case I can't even say that because in no way will this help someone with a bad back or someone who needs a rub.

I bought this lamp because it says it doesnt give off any glare and is easy on the eyes for reading, doing crafts, sewing........... Well it doesnt giove off much light either!!!! So you need another source of light in your work area also......... I didnt think it would fill up the room with beautiful NATURAL light but c'mon.........all in all its an overpriced night light!!

Cheezy as cheezy can be.   The only feature I liked was that this item could be returned!  The sound was terrible, not easy to tune, flimsy design and the gimmick to have it look like a bug was only cute if you are 10 years old.  This thing is junk and not worth the price of the batteries it requires.   Mine was promptly returned

The little radio does not have the ability for station lock-in. Every time it is turned on it reverts to a station set at the manufacturer. Since there are no indicators or displays it is annoying and time consuming having to constantly reset the station(s). It also has lousy reception and lots of static can be heard when the radio is on

I thought these looked so cute when they came out, so I put it on my wishlist last year. From Day one, it has never worked right. Sometimes it just shuts off on it's own. Of course when you turn it back on you have to start at 88.9 again. There is no visible tuner, just a tiny hard button that hurts your finger when you press it. The antenna began getting rusty after a few months, finally this morning it broke off in my hand. I was able to stick it back in, but then wasn't able to tune a station. I turned it upside down and finally got something.

If you want hassle free, ease of use, and good quality, this is not for you.

I would have given it zero stars but that is not an option. It stopped working after about 10 minutes of static filled reception. It was difficult to get a station. And it was not a problem with the batteries. Run, don't walk, *away* from this

Doesn't show you what station you are listening to.  It starts over at 88.9 every time you shut it off.  By the time you scan a few stations, it stops getting a signal and you have to start off at 88.9, again.

My girls bought this for their step dad for his birthday. He won't even listen to it any more because he has to reset the station every time he turns it on. We can never find the station we like without having another radio on to find it. The main reason he quit listening is because after I spent time trying to set the station in the morning, during his shower the station would automatically change to another one, give me a break! This is a worthless radio, it doesn't even deserve 1 star

I am a big fan of the regular CliC reading glasses. I own several pairs and think they are great. However, the Sport Goggles DO NOT get my vote of confidence. They have three problems which make them unusable for me: 1) on all CliC products there is an all important stem adjustment that adjusts the length of the stems to properly fit the glasses onto your head. However, unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by CliC, the Sport Googles do not adjust properly and so the Goggles run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem legnth, 2) there is also extra foam padding on the Sport Googles that make them very snug, but because of the tight stems the foam padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3)the maker doesn't make it as clear as they should in their description ... the Irridium (Red)colored lens on some of the Sports Goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking on a rocky path. Sorry Clic, but your success with the Reading Glasses went to your head ... you needed to do more user testing for comfort and vision with the Sports Goggles. I would like to return them for a larger size and lighter colored lens ... too bad for me!

I purchased these but had to return them.  while the molded strap is adjustable, it only opens up approx. 1".  The magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23.5" or larger around - at the eyebrows, forget it, these will not fit you

I first bought the standard, and then the large size in an attempt to have a pair that fit well. I used them riding a bike in the winter months. Neither pair fit well and there are most likely very few people who will obtain a good fit. For the goggles to be snug enough to prevent wind from entering (and prevent tearing) causes great pressure above the ear. The rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely. I retired my Clics when I found foam padded sunglasses for motorcyclists.

I'm sorry that I ordered these online. I should have tried them first.
They do not fit round heads. No matter how many times you adjust them they do not fit. The bow needs to have an adjustment too. 
The magnet is not that strong when put on a round head they just pop off.
Would not buy another pair.

I bought the goggles and was excited by the look. They are kind of "Riddick" like. They had disappoiinting performance when I rode my jet ski at 65 mph and they flew off my face. They did float and so I found them and tried it a second time and same thing happened. I gave them to my daughter and she will try to wear them skiing. They definately are not for extreme sports. They are also too big for casual use as sun glasses.

I lovelovelove dark chocolate, (and other strong, pungent things like goat cheese and dark beer) but these taste just plain wierd. It's not terrible, but I can taste the hoodia, sorta like dried grass mixed in with the chocolate. I think they work at reducing hunger, but they give me gas so bad I can't be sure if I want to eat less because of the hoodia, or the gas. Maybe I'll try the *regular* ChocoLeans, but I won't be buying this again.

FYI: I absolutely LOVE the Phytobase powdered chocolate hoodia shake mix. I have no problems with that. Tastes great, works great. And no gas!

I bought myself this book light after giving someone a $5 "robotic" book light from Walgreens. When she used hers it lit up the room. When I got mine today I tried it out and it barely lit up the palm of my hand. Had to smack it twice when the light flickered off to get it to come back on. It is flimsy, the light is dim and it's not worth the wait. Go to Walgreens instead. Mine is now lighting up the bottom of the trash can

Hello,

I recently bought this blood pressure monitor.....it functions all well......BUT it gives incorrect readings.......i mean the readings vary significantly........not once , twice...but many many times......I was and am never sure about the validity of the readings.....
Purchase this at your own risk.....my recommnedation would be to get a manual blood pressure monitor like the one with the doctors.....atleast u will know that the readings r genuine...and u can ALWAYS find someone who can spare 5 minutes and help u get the readings......
Take care and stay healthy......

There are so many different sites that all tell you that 'they' have the best absorbed CoEnzyme Q10 manufactured.  It's hard to know who is really telling the absolute truth or just propagandizing a product for quick sale.  We are born with extremely high levels of CoEnzyme Q10 and then it gets slowly used up as the years pass even if we actually eat the foods that resupply our bodies.  And who purposefully eats these foods for the CoEnzyme Q10 content?  The mitochondria in every single cell in our body needs this coenzyme for production of energy.  By the time we are over 40, our levels have dropped significantly and our energy levels have dropped with it.  I must admit that this Nature's Made product does NOT seem to increase my energy level like other company's CoEnzyme Q10 does.  So, from my own reaction to this product, I do not recommend this particular CoEnzyme Q10.  There are several other companies that make excellent, effective products (like Dr. Whitaker's and Dr. Sinatra's and Dr. William's) but not this Nature Made product

Do you want the real secret on how to grow your hair? First, you need to have a healthy diet that includes plenty of vegetables and protein. PROTEIN! Then you have to keep your hair and scalp clean, trim your ends, and not use heating appliances all the time! Lastly, drink water! That's the secret! You go on a hair care board and you'll find people who swear by Vivisical. They'll show you before and after pictures and in the after picture it's just the person with their head tilted all the back just to make it look like their hair grew 5 inches in 2 months! Don't believe that nonsense! If you buy Viviscal, you're a sucker! You're better off just taking a multi-vitamin

This is the classic original round stick Old Spice deodorant formula and now I realize that it is really dated.  The formula hasn't changed since its inception and you will know it when the alcohol starts to burn your underarms.   If you want the great smell of Old Spice then just use the After Shave and Cologne, but stay away from the old stick deodorant.
I'll continue to use the Old Spice High Endurance deodorants which have improved modern formulas & scents and work much much better.

As an esthetician I would advise against using these sort of products. They basically sand your face off. Please leave microderm and abrasive exfoliation to trained and licensed professionals. I can assure you that I am not just saying this to drum up business. 

I would much rather have people not do anything to their skin than to use a product like this. You initially see great results because of the aggressiveness of the exfoliation, but believe me, you will pay for it in the long run. The main ingredient in this product is aluminum oxide (also referred to as corundum), which is characteristically known for its hardness, and is typically used as an industrial abrasive in sandpaper and as a component in cutting tools. This material is rated as 9 out of 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, making it second only to diamonds in abrasiveness. You may argue that this is also the same substance use in clinical microdermabrasion procedures, but you need to realize that these procedures can only be preformed by a board certified plastic surgeon, dermatologist, or licensed esthetician trained in microdermabrasion treatment. I see people coming in every day who use these at home kits and products, and they all have the same issue; It worked great at first, then after some time they started to notice that it wasn't working as effectively, so they used it more often and harder.

Exfoliation of the skin increases cell turnover and helps prepare the skin for hydration and moisturization when done right. When this process is done more often than necessary, or in an overly aggressive manner, you can end up damaging your skin and causing permanent scar tissue build up and inflammation. People don't seem to realize that there is oil on our face for a reason, it's there to protect and moisturize our skin. When you constantly cleanse and exfoliate your skin, you are doing more harm than good. Over stripping the skin causes irritation, break-outs, and heightened sensitivity that rarely can be reversed. When your skin is constantly bombarded by aggressive exfoliation, it's defense is to build up thicker layers of skin for protection. So please, if you do use this, use extreme caution, don't use it on your face, and do not use it more than once a week, if that. 

Ask any esthetician, plastic surgeon, or dermatologist out there and they'll tell you the same thing: there is a reason people don't get facials, chemical peels, and microderm every day, or even more once a month. The adage "too much of a good thing" stands true here.

if you need more convincing, please refer to the following links and make the decision your self.

Advil liquigels are excellent for headaches.  I am writing this review to warn customers that this product from Amazon does not ship in 1 or 2 weeks (as advertised).  I ordered this product more than 2 months ago and am still waiting for it to be shipped.  It is probably a good idea to spend the extra few bucks and buy this from the grocery store (like I had to eventually do when I ran out)

I have heard fabulous things about gripe water from fellow mothers, but this particular brand is horrible.  The scent is strong, and the taste is strong and medicinal.  There are other gripe water brands out there that do not have such scent/taste.

Upon ingesting only 1 ml of this gripe water, my 7 week old daughter gagged repeatedly and vomited.  Up until then, she never vomited before.

If you want to try gripe water, find another brand

Like the reviewer below, my dryer also stopped working within a short period. It was never dropped or misused -- after about a month, it simply refused to turn on when plugged in.
Now, there is a decent warranty for the product. However, with the money you spend on shipping and the $4 they request for handling/return shipping, buying another inexpensive dryer starts to sound like a better deal.

I don't know if the other reviewer and I got the only two lemons, but since we both found our way to Amazon with this review, I wouldn't recommend the product to other buyers

This product would be excellent but runs fully 4" too narrow and 3" too short.  This creates an aprox. 2" lip around the entire matress. Very odd. This short coming disturbs the experience substantially. The laminated back works well. Be sure to purchase the product sized for a bed size larger than the one you own and it should be fine

Every time we used this scale it gave a drastically different weight.  We returned it to Amazon, probably the first time we've ever had to do that.  For the price it should at least work.  Also, in only the 4 days we had it a large chip came off the corner.  It earns two stars for looking great.  I would not recommend it.

Everyone in my family has owned these clic goggles.  My original pair gave out after three years of use.  I ordered these because they said "standard size" they normally come in small medium and large.  WEll, I am medium and the standard size is large (same as my husbands).  I had to tape them at the back to make them smaller so I could wear them.  Did not have time to return....very disappointed.  Will consider this before ordering from you again.

The Amazon.com listing is very misleading

This is the worst waste of money I have ever had. the only good thing about this mirror is the suction cups. 3x magnification??? more like 9x !!!  you have to have your face right on the mirror or it looks like you are standing by one of those funny distorted amusment park mirrors.
My suggestion would be not to waste your money on it. its a joke

So, yeah, it mounts in your bathroom with the suction cups, and once it's mounted, it stays put pretty well.  Unfortunately, it has so far never actually been "fogless."  Get a good shower going, and the mirror fogs up in record time.  Splash some water on it, and you can see yourself for half a minute, but overall, this is a disappointment.

I originally planned to purchase Locin floss to replace the DenTek, but I'm not too pleased with it so far.

PLUSES
=======
-Each individually wrapped floss.
-Doesn't contain floride.

MINUSES
=======
-Flimpsy handle--almost not usable.
-Wrap is not 100% sealed.
-flossing head is shallower and narrower than the DenTek

This is a very cheaply built product.  We had a hard time getting it to mist at all.  Even though the instruction say fill it with water at least 1 inch above the misting device it took trial and error to find the exact right level that it would mist at.  When it did mist it would not get more than about 1/3 inch from the top.  So, the mist never made it out of the bowl.  We did like the changing color lights

Mercury contamination is a VERY big deal especially if you are going to take a product "for life", are pregnant or a child.
 
Many fish oil products have Mercury contamination and are NOT filtered. Is this product  Mercury free?? 

So far the only product that was certified Mercury free was available from my medical doctor by a prescription.

1500 mgs etc... advertised, is misleading as 1500 mgs refer to the daily recommended dose contained in two pills. Honest advertising would quote 750 mgs etc... Per pill! I will definitively not purchase any product from that unreliable source. I believe Amazon should check it's suppliers with more scrutiny as their misconduct reflects on Amazon - a generally very reliable ecommerce site.

Won't even cut hairs you stick directly into the blade. The shape and slots of the housing covering the blade would only cut hair that was as dense as a forest, and then only if you shoved it in hard

These are just OK, not great. I have 2 pairs of the clic readers and I love them. The sunglasses, however, are not as sturdy, the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and I just cannot endorse them. I am disappointed as I am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses. It's a shame

Some products lead to real improvement of your skin (retin A, exfoliators) while others simply cover up the imperfections acting like a make up. The sad and hillarious thing is that most consumers mix up makeup effects with real skin improvement.

The Regenerist contains SILICONES that fill in small wrinkles and mattify the skin surface thus acting like an invisible makeup. Such effects lead most consumers to believe their crow's feet are smaller. If you really want to do a test, you should stop using the product for a few days using only face wash. If during that time you observe smaller wrinkles then the product works. You can't really claim the wrinkles are smaller while the product is on your face covering them hello....
And another thing, a wrinkle can't be erased in one or 3 weeks - the skin doesn't produce collagen that fast (unless you cut it).

Paying $18 / 1.7 oz (retail price, its cheaper on amazon but you have to pay shipping price) for a silicone makeup is a little steep for me provided that there are cheaper products on the market that will make your skin look equally good cause they contain the same silicone base even better -  try Monistat soothing care - chafing relief powder gel 1.5 OZ, $7 at CVS. 

I have been using Matrixyl(the active peptide in Regenerist) for 6 months in my own formulations (without silicones) and frankly speaking haven't noticed any improvement in my crows feet or the lines on my forehead. Currently there is only one study of the effects of Matrixyl conducted by Sederma - the MANIFACTURER of Matrixyl which makes me quite suspicious about the whole story ...

I will never purchase another Neutrogena product, again.  There products are dangerous!!!  It burned my face.  My face is all red, swollen, red, irritated, and itchy.  My new best friend is Cortizone 10, the anti itch cream.  It's been a week since I stopped using Netrogena, and I still look horrifying!!!!  Perfect for Halloween, right?  But, Halloween is over, and I still look scary.  This product has aged me!!!  It has caused a ton of wrinkles from where the skin is puffy and swollen.  NEVER, AGAIN, NEUTROGENA!!!

I found these diapers while searching for the 7th generation brand diapers. I was impressed and eager to try Tushies because there was no chlorine and no gell used to produce them, I ordered the medium size for my 20lb baby. The diapers came sooner then expected, which was great. My single star rating comes from my experience using them. They have no elastic and they are stiff which makes it hard to get a super snug fit. It seems like no matter how tight I can get the diapers my son leaks through them, out the sides and up the belly. Because the moisture does not wick away from his skin he also developed a diaper rash- his first and we have been only using these diapers for a week

Do not buy this prouct because it is made of cheap quality and the attachable plastic combs are hard to attach and break very easily. The small parts that attach the combs also snapped off without applying much force. This product looks like a good value because of the number of accessories, but they will be useless when you throwing it out within only two months as I was forced to after all of the parts broke off. Save your money and avoid

Please careful about this Grooming Kit. I bought one week before and when I turn on first time it did not work and plug the power it did not work. This product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not. This lag of simple feature make me wait for 2 hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair. Also this can not be used for continuous use, if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge

I bought this press to do crafts.  The dimensions I were given were completely wrong.  I was told the Product in Inches (L x W x H): 9.0 x 20.0 x 15.0  It really is barely 6 1/2 inches wide and a little over 12 inches long, 17 inces long at the angle.   It was so small that I could maybe iron one sock at a time.  Also, the green light never came on after 1 hour of warming up and   Real waste of money and very misleading picture on the amazon website

I like the concept of no chemicals in a diaper, so I bought Tushies.  When my baby was newborn, they seemed to work ok, maybe because she didn't put out that much.  She is now three months old.  I practice attachment parenting so I know exactly when she has a bowel movement.  The past two bowel movements the diaper has leaked horribly.  She was sitting on my lap, she had a bowel movement, five seconds later I got up to change her, the feces was all over my pants.  This has happened several times.  The concept of the diaper is great, but the diaper needs some work around the legs

I recently bought 3 items from this brand - Lumiscope. Actually this is the only item that works among them. Though I am kind of suspicious about it's inconsistent readings from time to time. 

I think Braun IRT452 is a much better product, which I bought one for my parents in China. During SARS epidemic it never failed and provided consistent readings.

Maybe it's just my bad luck, but I ordered this item and it came out with the expired battery. I called Amazon, and they sent me a replacement quickly. The thing is that the replacement was in exactly the same *not working* condition. The same problem with the battery. I was suggested to shop somewhere else for this item, as Amazon vendor don't check the condition of the items before they ship them to customers. Be aware! Don't waste your time

Contrary to purported performance claims, my experience with these batteries has significantly worsened my opinion of Duracell's products. Decades of experience with Everready Energizers - and with other Duracell products (e.g., Coppertops) - show ProCell products to be markedly inferior in performance.  Regardless of how long their shelf life may be, they simply haven't performed up to par, much less equally to other Alkaline batteries.

This has just been my experience - over daily use, over many months, with set after set of ProCell AA batteries.  Take it for what its' worth

I am a HUGE fan of Olay products and use their foaming face wash, moisturizers (including the Regenerist Continuous Night Recovery is a great product)... so I was really dissapointed to spend $16+ on this product and then see no change.  I am in my 30's, have fair/medium shade combination skin.  I tried using it on various types of spots from a beauty mark to a break-out spot that was healing.  I tried using it a couple of times a day, at first blending it in and then even leaving a dollop on the marks while I slept (not blending it into my skin).  I tried it for several weeks.  No results.  This product did nothing for me.  I would not recommend it.  I would have given it zero start, but Amazon does not allow it.  

Avon has a product out that touts similar claims to Olay's product.  I have not tried it yet but would suggest you see if you can try a sample of that from an Avon rep. instead.

I've used the CardioChek 6 times, and had my cholesterol checked at a doctor's office during the same period.  My cholesterol levels according to the doctor's tests are always around 200.  With the CardioChek they vary by as much as 90 points.  It is a lot of trouble (and expensive) to purchase 3 sets of test strips and stab myself 3 times to test total Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, and Triglycerides.  No test strips are included in the package when I purchased the CardioChek.  The box says "includes check strips" but those are something other than test strips

I bought this product and the accuracy depends on having good test strips.
I simultaneously had bloodwork at the Doctor's office when I did the test.
Except for the total cholesterol, all the other tests were off.  The manual states to check for the blue color at the back of the test strips after the test is done.  Except for total cholestrol the other test strips did not have a blue color.  The test strips which are expensive were bad. I am planning on returning this produc

I purchased the product .  Found it to be not accurate.  Also in order to get your LDL result you have to use 3 types of strips and a formula to calculate it - Costly !!  cumbersome !!! 3 times "niddle" your fingers !!

  Molly, daughter or Richard- I usually write positive reviews on this site but not this time. Why on earth do dermatologists recommend this s***? Last year my hormones were all out of wack and I had a period for a whole month. I broke out severely as one would expect. Dermatologists  (including mine) swear by this aweful chetaphil. I HATE IT! It wasnt strong enough for my skin. It made my acne even worse if you can imagine! I'd been using it for four months when I finally decided enough was enough and I started using Neutrogena Frangrance Free Facial Cleanser. That change made all the difference in the world! I still do have acne but now it is mild acne instead of severe acne. Now its mostly just old, light scarring and the occasional breakouts around my chin and lips the week before my period.  One of my friends is a dietition and she also has used Cetaphil and didnt like it at all. Please do not buy Cetaphil even if your dermatologist recommends it. You will totally regret it

I bought this for my husband and son and was not even able to give one hair cut.  It pulled the hair, and didn't cut well.  My husband kept complaining that it hurt and was pulling.  Since I couldn't finish, I had to use our old clippers to get the job done.  This was so disappointing, but I guess you get what you pay for.

While Bumble and Bumble used to be one of my favorite lines of hair care products, this conditioner (and I might add shampoo by the same name) was a real disappointment. 

Using it left no softening or conditioning effect and there wasn't even a pleasant scent. Don't know where Bumble fumbled but they certainly fouled up on this one. I'm saving my $$$$$ for Lush and Frederic Fekkai!

I have never used such an impactless (if that is a word) product. There is absolutely no effect whatsoever, not even remotely. It is simply a waste of money and bottle. I am terribly disappointed - you are better off blowing air and water over your ingrown hair areas for better effect.....

I've been using TrimSpa X32 for over a year and, with a decent diet and regular excersise, I've lost over 40 pounds. The X32 formula has helped me maintain my weight with no side effects at all. I, too, decided to use TrimSpa Energy because it was new and improved, but was sorely disappointed. The Engergy formula is way too high powered (200mg Caffeine per pill) for me and has made me feel "sped-up", sweaty, greasy and just plain gross. And that's taking under the suggested dosage. I'm sure that it will help drop the pounds for you...at the expense of dilated pupils, shaky hands and acting sketchy. I don't think this pill should be legal and should come with stronger warnings. I'm going back to the other formula tomorrow...that is if I can get to sleep!

One-battery trimmers simply not strong enough, was glad to find a two-batteries version. It has a perfect design which will attract many more naive surfers like me. Unfortunately it's not good for nose hair trimming. Problem is it makes electric-like unpleasant sensations when touches sensitive skin inside nose.
So much that it makes you scared using it ;-) It also doesn't cut well, doesn't reach inside, makes burning smell and overheated. 

UPDATE On 2/7/2007:
 From my recent experience, the MicroTOUCH Turbo is an excellent alternative which has no problems mentioned above. The only problem is its durability (you may find yourself buying 2 per year) but at the price below $10 this is not a real issue. Good luck

Please note that any electric razor requires at least 10 days use in order to properly condition the skin so that you can have a good shave with it.

I have used the Panasonic ES8043 for about 20 days now and it still tears my face to shreds every time I use it. 

Stay clear of this device unless you have stubble like a porcupine, it's like French kissing jaws.  The worst part is that no matter how bad you let it tear at you, you still have stubble left that no amount of choppi.. shaving will remove.

Seriously, this must be one of those devices left over from the Spanish inquisition.

Tylenol is an over-the-counter medication that contains as its active ingredient "Acetaminophen". Acetaminophen is an analgesic drug that treats mild to moderate pain, making it a great headache reliever, or a medication that treats mild strains, sprains, toothaches, etc. It also acts to reduce fever. Acetaminophen is commonly used in place of aspirin for those allergic to aspirin. One drawback of Acetaminophen is that it does not reduce inflammation (therefore, it has limited use in arthritis swelling reduction). It has few side-effects. Those with liver disease should avoid Acetaminophen, as it is hard on the liver. 

Tylenol (Acetaminophen) came into great prominence when aspirin fell out of favor due to the incidence of Reye's Syndrome and aspirin in children. 

Tylenol is the manufacturer's proprietary name for Acetaminophen. There is a generic form of Acetaminophen that is also sold over the counter, and this version is much cheaper than "Tylenol", and the container usually contains more tablets/pills, etc. The generic form of Acetaminophen is just as effective as Tylenol, just cheaper priced. 

Sometimes Acetaminophen is combined with other medications for dual action. For example, Tylenol PM has diphenhydramine (the active ingredient in Benadryl), which causes sedation and acts like a good sleeping pill. Diphenhydramine also is an anti-histamine, so it work for itching and allergies too. 

Tylenol is packaged in different strengths: Extra-strength at 500 mg per tablet, Standard (325 mg per tablet), and children's dose of 80 mg. Tylenol may also be packaged in a timed-release version, called "extended release". Rather than the tablet dissolving all at once in the stomach, the tablet slowly releases acetaminophen throughout the digestive tract. 

All in all, Acetaminophen is a great product. If you want a "name brand" of Acetaminophen, Tylenol is your brand (although it will cost more). My choice is to by the generic brand as it is cheaper by the dozen.

I bought this from QVC.  It will do the trick for quick touch-ups - not close hair removal, but close enough.  Unfortunately, mine is barley operating anymore, even with a fresh battery.  I'm not sure why the motor seems to be dying.  Maybe the life of the trimmer is not that long.  As a result, I think it would be better to buy a cheaper one since it should work just as well

I bought this from QVC after I had to send back a Braun Silk Epil. The epilator really irritated by skin caused major bumps and redness. Waxing just hurts too much and is really messy. This sounded ideal I just wanted to have a smoother look on my cheeks, and upper lip. It trims down your facial hair however, the next day you will notice stubble. You have to really look close to see it, but you can really feel it. You might as well shave. I have not used the brow attachment, I saw the demo on QVC but am afraid I will shave my brows off. Would love to know what others think of this item

This hair dryer was purchased as a Christmas gift to replace one we have had for several years.  I could not locate one locally so I order from Amazon. The dryer only worked for a few days.  Nothing I do will make it work again.  The reason I have not retured it is because the postage cost would be so much.

This is an inexpensive scale for measuring weight and body fat.  The only problem is it doesn't do either one too well.  The weight measurement gives a different answer every time you step on it, even if you weighed yourself just a minute before.  

I was never able to get the scale to measure my fat percentage or give me any other reading besides an error.  Maybe my skin's too thick, or maybe the electrical charge it tries to send through your body is too weak.

It's also inconvenient to use.  To get your weight, all you have to do is step on it.  To get the weight and fat reading, you have to hit the power button multiple times to cycle through all the settings, then step on the scale within 5-10 seconds to avoid it turning back off

Nothing but problems with unit since I received it.  Either it did not work when I went to use it or it had lost its memory and had to be recalibrated all over again.  Never had the same weight reading twice! The only reason I rated it with 1 star is because it would not let me enter anything less

You could get the same info on "percentage" of body fat by going online. Think about it: how does a scale "measure" your body fat? Good question. So I went to the website of the manufacturer and...surprise, surprise...there were no details about HOW this worked. It did, however, note what it was SUPPOSED to detect and how that might connect to body fat.  

The scale supposedly measures something called "electrical impedence" which sounds pretty complex but really isn't all that hard to understand. All it means is that the more fat you have in your body, the more "impedence" you have and the higher the body fat reading. Electricity doesn't flow as well through fat and the scale is supposed to detect that. 

BUT HERE IS THE CATCH - getting an ACCURATE body fat measurement can not possibly be done by just stepping on a scale, especially if the consumer (buyer) of that scale doesn't understand the factors that are VITAL to an accurate measurement. What you have in your body when you step ON the scale is one vital factor. 


Here is just one example of how easy it would be to get a bad reading:
 If you are dehydrated from not drinking enough water or, conversely, you are OVERhydrated from drinking too much water or you haven't measured your body fat within a certain amount of time AFTER exercise or you've been standing too long or you've eaten recently.....you are very likely to get an inaccurate reading and you'll be confused by the variation in readings from one day to the next, not knowing WHAT factor or combination of factors is affecting your reading. Even worse, you'll have no real idea of your body fat.

From what I've seen, these scales do provide accurate weight measurements.But when it comes to measuring body fat,the ads or website do not seem to indicate that you can get an inaccurate reading if you step on the scale at the wrong time of day, too soon after exercising, if you are thirsty, etc.

So save your money.  If you are working out regularly, eating right, getting in shape, etc....odds are that your body fat is dropping and you'll see signs of this. You don't need this scale to prove it (although you might consider it worthwhile to discover your actual body fat some other way). 

Signs of reduced body fat are firmer muscles, looser clothes and (often) a more streamlined figure. Your metabolism is likely to be more efficient, assuming you don't overeat too much. If you absolutely HAVE to know your percentage of body fat, just ask your local physician, trainer or gym director how to get an accurate assesment and when to do so. If you workout regularly at the suggested or peak training level, your body fat should go down, assuming you don't compensate by eating too much. 

So don't count on this scale to give you the consistency or quality of a detailed and CONTROLLED body fat measurement. It won't.

At Christmas 2003 I was very excited with the $50 scale my family purchased for me. It worked as advertised for about six months. Then it displayed the ERR message more and more. We replaced the battery. Then it would not permit any function buttons to perform. We just sighed and used my expensive gift as any $7 bathroom scale. When it went completely blank this week, battery of no use, I hopped on the internet to see what anyone else's experience is. To be fair, I will contact the manufacturer and see if they can make it right. I hope they can. If not, I will see what the Weight Watchers scales is like. Sigh ...

After reading several comments I tried to proof my scale is working properly. However, like someone else wrote the scale is not consistant. I weight myself several times and noticed very considerable diferrences in readings. Like some one else I even tried placing an additional amount of weight in my hands. The scale gave me several readings for the same amount of weight. Now! A digital scale is supposed to be percise..

First of all, the battery that was supposed to be enclosed was not. When I bought a 9 volt battery and installed it, it would not stay attached when putting it back in the battery compartment. Finally, I got a read out, and entered my height and age. Then I stood on the scale and got nothing - no weight, no body fat, nothing, but the word ERROR, at which point I boxed it up and sent it back for a refund

I had this for about 2 years, and was not impressed.  It worked for a month or so, and since then, does nothing.  If you fill it up with water, and then plug it in for several days, the water level never goes down.  I've tried cleaning it repeatedly, and tried various things to make it work, but apparently it's just dead.  It was a cheap product; you get what you pay for

I just bought this small fountain for my office at work thinking that the soothing sound of water would be a nice addition.  However, after setting it up, I added the water and the waited and waited and waited to hear the cascading sound of water.  No cascading sound.  I added more water -- nothing... I added less water -- absolutely nothing.  The design is built such that the water moves down without making any noise.  It is useless from that perspective... plus, you can tell it is made of plastic so it isn't really that nice to look at either.  I would definitely not buy this again and am contemplating getting rid of it after 1 week of use

This item is more of a foot and ankle massager if you have long legs.  I am tall with a 37" inseam.  This item is not made for someone who has longer than "average" legs unless you're looking for a foot and ankle massage rather than a calf massage.

This item is very heavy and bulky.  Descriptions give you the idea that your feet will endure the "kneading" action as well as your calves; however that is not the case.  Your feet only rest on these two painful round balls that only vibrate should you wish them too.  The "kneading" pressure can not be regulated, only the speed.  The "kneading" pressure is VERY intense and can be very uncomfortable at times.  If my massage therapist ever worked like this I would fire immediately.  I tired to like it, however quickly returned after a few days

If you get it wet it stops working, which is quite ironic given its a toothbrush. If you want something to work for a month or two its fine, otherwise avoid it entirely. I intitally thought the water was effecting the battery compartment but after cleaing the contacts and replacing the batteries it seems clear to me that the motor fails due to moisture, pretty quickly after ordinary use

Since our bathroom cabinet is short on space, I loved the IDEA of this hair dryer! Unfortunately, the idea was more a fantasy than a reality. I only had this hair dryer for about a month before the cord-keeper button fell out (spring and all!) and the retractible cord stopped retracting. Since that was the only reason I bought this one over other models, I was sorely disappointed! Also, this dryer is so L-O-U-D that I had to wear earplugs (no kidding!) while drying my hair so that I wouldn't damage my hearing! Hands down the WORST hair dryer on the market

It worked fine for 2 -3  weeks and then it would get about half way through blow drying my SHORT hair and it would just stop.  I had to let it rest for 10 minutes and then it worked again.  Gradually the time it worked got shorter and shorter and eventually it just stopped all together.  Very frustrating.  Go get a professional dryer.  it might cost a bit more but it'll work!  And probably for a long time

I loved ths retractable cord hair dryer when I first bought it about a year ago.  Now it's starting to stop running.  It appears to be a short in the power cord in the inclosed casing.  When I'm using it...it works then it stops, then I shake it and then it starts to work again, sometimes.  My last hair dryer lasted over 20 years.  They just don't make products like they use to. For this price I shouldn't expect much.   I guess you really do get what you pay for!  This hair dryer is perfect to take on an airline.   If it's not allowed on the plane and they throw it out,......who cares

I have used three of these.  The first two each lasted a year before shorting out.  I kept buying them because I liked the cordkeeper function.  This last one, though, shorted out and started a fire.  I have notified the company and will see what happens.  But I doubt that I will purchase another.  It's obvious that this product has an engineering or manufacturing flaw and should be pulled off the market.

Having owned several Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers over a 20 year period I can, with authority, say that this model is a big disappointment. The battery life is outstanding, but that's because the motor speed is so slow it's not using much juice. And with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor. The next time I won't pinch pennies; the higher priced models from Panasonic are worth the price difference

This one is too small for a bedroom, just like a toy.  I returned this one and reordered Sunbeam 701-000 Ultrasonic Humidifier, which is much bigger.  Generally speaking, the ultrasonic humidifier is much quieter than the regular ones

I bought this scale as an upgrade from a Wal Mart cheapo scale.  Hated it!!  I should have read the dimensions more carefully, but it was so large that it became the focal point of our bathroom.  Worse still, it never displayed the same weight twice in a row even when second weight was taken immediately after the first.  Had to reset it to zero and then the same drill happened again.  Returned the item, but ate the $11 return ship fee  - it's huge AND heavy

These wipes clean well.

They arrived promptly. 

They stink something fierce. 

I cannot stand the way they smell.

Did not work at all. I used cheaper products that I bought from walgreens and walmart that reduced the razor bumps but not completely eliminate them.
Since Princereigns promised to be a miracle product, I bought it in hopes of completely eliminating the bumps but it did't even reduce them. Complete waste of money

Sturdy enough for the price, but no power.  Replaced original battery with a new duracell.  Still fuctioned like the battery was drained.  Like I mentioned before, what do you expect for the price

I got this product after seeing the ads on tv for possibly the hundredth time.  I need to clean dirty fingerprints off my cabinets.  I opened the package.  Followed directins exactly and got nothng for my troubles.  I used the first sponge in the package.  It got less than half a cabinet door clean before it started breaking apart in my hand.  I was willing to accept that the first one was possibly defective but not the second one.  It cleaned an area smaller than the size of a quarter before it started coming apart in my hand.  I wasn't even pressing very hard.  I'll stick to my sponges with the scrubbing pads for cleaning my cabinets and other things around my house.  I'm a little ticked that this didn't last for one good cleaning let alone one good minute.
