7,"B000BFQ3PK:just_what_i_have_been_looking_for:pamela_jamieson_""maverick_and_harbinger""","I have been using the Prince Reigns product for 7 days and have noticed a wonderful difference in my hair. My hair naturally is typical of those descendant from the African Diaspora. For years I used a commercially available hair relaxer that advertised its product as ""Botanical"". I last relaxed my hair with this product five months ago. One day, I decided to read the ingredient label on the box and was astonished that it actually said the product was toxic and listed the ingredients that where especially poisonous. Needless to say, I no longer wanted to use the product and began searching the Internet for ways to enjoy the beauty of my hair without using poison. In the interim, I decided to braid my hair and use a wig until I could find a solution.  Through an exhaustive search on the Internet I came across the Prince Reigns product. It advertised the softening, straightening and 100% natural properties I was looking for in addition to being something both men and women could use. However, I did not find anyone who had actually used the product as a natural hair relaxer. I decided to give the product the ""Old College Try"" anyway and am pleased with the results. I used the product on my entire head. My hair is 10 ½ inches long with about 2 ½ inches of hair that was new growth from the last time I used a toxic hair relaxer. In the week I have been using the product it has done exactly as advertised. My hair is softer and straighter. The difference between my hair that was straightened using a toxic relaxer and the new growth is diminishing. Today, I have unbraided my hair and don't feel the need to wear a wig. My hair feels and looks great. The Prince Reigns product is just what I have been looking for.",5.0,positive

112,"B000050FE0:easy_temperature-_taking_device:bryan_carey_""bryan_carey""","Braun IRT 4520 Ear Thermometer is an excellent device for taking temperatures, especially in small children and infants. Most families have an oral thermometer and some use other types, like rectal or those that are placed under the armpit. These other thermometers are generally ok with certain age groups but when it comes to the very young, an ear thermometer is the best option. And the Braun IRT 4520 is one of the best on the market. This thermometer gives accurate results in about 30 to 45 seconds. They way it accomplishes its task is by using infrared technology to measure the level of heat generated by the eardrum and other tissue. Some may question the ear as an accurate place to measure ones' body temperature but according to many medical experts, the ear actually provides greater accuracy than oral and other types of thermometers. Of all the pluses with this device, the most important among them is the ease of use. Babies generally don't like anything placed inside their ears but they don't resist this type of thermometer like they do others. I had tried using the armpit style thermometer but the squirming and crying was too much. With this, there is still a little bit of annoyance for both your baby and you but it is nothing compared to the aggravation caused by other types of thermometers. On occasion, this thermometer may have a problem producing an accurate measurement and when it does, it will let you know on the display panel. For example, if the tip isn't inserted properly in the ear, you will get the error code ""POS"", indicating that the positioning is not secure. If the surrounding air is too hot or too cold (needs to be between 50 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit), you will get the ""Err"" error message. If a person's temperature is far too high or too low, (outside the 93.2 to 108 degrees Fahrenheit range) you will get ""HI"" or ""LO"". If this happens, don't panic- chances are you didn't insert the thermometer correctly or the filter isn't clean. Replace the filter if necessary and try again. One of the many nice things about this device is that it comes complete with batteries. This may not seem like a big deal but it is no fun when you buy a new electronic device, race home, and discover you forgot the batteries. Braun knows that when people buy a thermometer, it is usually because they need to use it immediately. They don't want the unexpected surprise of having no batteries. Braun includes these for your convenience. And the fact that the batteries are ordinary AA is also convenient because this type of battery is easy to find. Yet another plus with this thermometer is that it stores the last temperature in memory. This temperature will display when you turn the unit on, allowing you to see the last reading and compare it to the reading you are about to take. This is nice because it takes the guesswork out of the task. Often, a pediatrician will ask if you know the previous temperature so that he/she can make comparisons and check progress in the case of illness. With this device, it is right there, on the panel when you turn it on. And when you take a new temperature, the reading remains on the screen for sixty seconds for your convenience. Could this thermometer be improved in any way? Well, I can only think of a few minor things. One would be a gripping surface- perhaps a small section around the middle with a rubber covering to help consumers hold the device more firmly in place. Another possible improvement would be a lighted display panel, just in case you need to use the thermometer in a dark place. These and other changes could make the thermometer even more appealing, but they are minor and shouldn't count for much in a buying decision. To keep things as sanitary as possible, it is important to always replace the lens filter before each use. This is a small plastic cap that fits over the tip of the measuring device and it needs to be replaced after each use. These replacement filters can be purchased in most drug stores and on- line at a cost of less then ten dollars for a pack of forty. This is an added cost for owning this type of thermometer. But any type of thermometer is going to include its share of cleaning/sanitation costs so, again, this shouldn't have too much affect on one's decision to buy. Overall, this thermometer has proven itself a godsend for me and my family. The ease of use, the memory storage of the last temperature reading, and the long battery life (about two years or 1000 measurements) make this a must have for anyone with babies or toddlers. It eliminates much of the fussiness and frustration common with other thermometers and even though it carries a hefty price tag, it is worth the extra cost.",5.0,positive

About 6 years ago, my dentist recommended that I switch over to Glide floss, which at the time was a god-send.  Glide made flossing rather quick work to remove food particles between my teeth without shredding (it's strongest advantage).  After some years of use with Glide, I felt that it didn't leave my mouth as clean as the traditional floss (which has some ""roughness"" to it and would polish teeth as well as removing large food particles, but with very low shred resistance).By chance, I happened to try out some Reach Flouride Woven Floss, and this product is a very good compromise between cleaning/polishing in-between teeth (normal floss) and shred-resistance (Glide floss).  The Reach Flouride WOVEN floss (note the term ""WOVEN"" as the differentiator from their normal line) looks like an unraveled piece of willowy cotton when unstressed, however, when pulled taut it assumes a very traditional thin thread-like normal floss appearance.  It works very well in-between my tight teeth (just about as good as normal ""non-woven"" floss), leaves them feeling minty clean (along w/ flouride protection), and has about 80% of the shred-resistance of Glide floss.  Given the very excellent cleaning properties and relatively good shred-resistance, this Reach Flouride WOVEN floss has won me over.  I should also note that as of this time, there is also a Reach Mint WOVEN floss as well.  I haven't tried it yet, but as the Reach Flouride WOVEN floss is rather minty already and has added flouride content, I'll be sticking with this excellent current product",5.0,positive

I have several issues with eating - I tend to eat very large portions when I am really enjoying a meal, I snack a lot, and I have a major sweet tooth. This product has taken care of all 3 problems.I am currently taking 1000 mg 3 times a day. I plan to cut back a little once I'm at my target weight. I find that this dosage will generally suppress my appetite and/or urge to eat for 3-6 hours. It's odd for me to experience hunger without cravings and a frantic urge to eat...but that's what the pills do for me. Most of the time I can tell I'm hungry only because my stomach is growling and it has been several hours since my last meal...but I don't feel like I have to eat anything right away. I can go grocery shopping when I'm hungry and not make poor choices, and even when I finish up at the gym after work I don't feel ravenous anymore.I definitely get full faster. It doesn't feel like it used to when I overate, I just can tell I've eaten enough and I stop. What a concept! And often I can just have a bite or two and be good for another 30-60 min if I'm too busy to sit down and eat. My urge to snack has really been curbed. I still have one or two snacks most days, but they are much smaller and often more healthy. Now I can actually stay up several hours past dinner without making another mini-meal, which I used to do almost every night.Hoodia does not completely kill my appetite, it suppresses it quite a bit but more than anything it takes away all of my cravings. That is definitely my favorite part - I used to crave sugar from morning until night practically every day. Since my first day on these pills, the only time I've had sweets is when someone has offered me something. I'm able to eat just a little and not wish for ten times more. It does not occur to me to go to the vending machine at work anymore, or buy candy when I'm shopping. Maybe even more than the weight loss, the emotional benefits of these pills are incredible for me. I'm no longer berating myself constantly for overeating or having too much candy or dessert.

230,B0000DBNER:curling_hair_is_no_longer_a_challenge:m._lu,"At first I was skeptical because I've always used curling irons in the past.  And on top of that, my ventures into hot roller systems weren't wonderful.  They were hot for one and bulky.  And a set with enough curlers to fit my head took up way too much counter space.  Curling irons were an OK alternative for me for many years but it would burn if it was too hot or not curl if it wasn't hot enough.  Soon I wasn't doing anything except blow drying...Then I decided to get this set.  I've never heard of steam setter before but it sounded like it was worth a try.  And I'm so glad I did!  It's a mix between sponge curlers and heated curlers so it's pretty comfortable because it's softer and lighter than regular hot rollers.  But it still easy to to snap right into your hair.The steam is the secret (I use filtered/bottled water because I'm afraid of having the hard water build up in the unit. I just keep a bottle in my bathroom).  You hair can be unstylably dry and it would still curl.  Plus the steam leaves your hair soft, just like when you first blow-dry wet hair.  I usually put the curlers in before going through my morning make-up routine.  You should take them out before you change or if you have a 30 minute car ride, take them out before you leave the house so the curls can loosen up a bit.  That's all there is too it.  If you want to set with some hair spray...go right ahead!This product comes with a unit that produces steam which has a regular and an ionic mode.  I don't know what the difference is except that when it's on ionic mode, it creates more steam and is more noisy. Regular mode is silent.  It also comes with lots of rollers in 3 sizes.  You can stow the curlers away under the sink or in the closet and just leave the steam unit on your counter (It's about the size of a box of Olay Facial Cloths).You should try it if you want to curl your hair often. Unless you put your hand right up to the steam vent, there is no chance of you burning yourself and the rollers don't get hot enough to damage your hair either.  Like all curling products, it takes practice and a couple of trail runs to get the configuration and timing down.  Then, it's a piece of cake",5.0,positive

Here's what I have found.I HAVE REALLY TESTED THEM ALL !I am very particular about spending my hard earned on something that seems cheap or looks like it only cost $5 to make overseas.  So I generally tend the gravitate to the higher/highest end of product lines.I have tested and owned the following:Norelco's newest Speed XL's 9170XLCCNorelco Spectra 8 James Bond seriesNorelco's Cool shave Nivea lotion dispenser built in (Don't even bother!)Braun's 360 #8995, Made in Germany-their best model  Panasonic ES8228 Vortex Nano Triple Blade HydraSystem II - A Brookstone Exclusive model but the same as the ES8168SI have tested all of these over the course of 2 years.  They all perform cleaning functions with a cleaning unit, or they can be rinsed under a faucet.HERE'S THE RESULTSNORELCO'SNorelco's newest Speed XL triple blade system is absolutely NO better than the Spectra 8 (James Bond Series) or above. It may actually be worse because of the smaller cutter sizes. It does however provide a comfortable shave that Norelco is most known for. It's easy, smooth and quiet.  Anyone can use this shaver and not get nicked.  It's a pleasure to hold and almost makes you move in circles which seems to attack the hair from any angle. As good as that is - IT JUST DOES NOT SHAVE AS CLOSE AS A BRAUN OR A PANASONIC.  Physics dictate that, the metal ringcups that hold the round blades are just to thick to pull the hair up and clip the hair below the surface as claimed. The cleaning system is huge and not ""intelligent"" like Braun's.  Overall a proven solid performer.  THE BRAUN 360 #8995This unit has a much better pivoting head design than past models and has a very unique foil that is supposed to grab the hairs more effeciently - well, it definately provides a closer shaver than previous models.  This shaver however is WORK. To get a really close shave you need to follow their directions of stretching and pulling your skin tight.  Most guys do this somewhat anyway, but to really get a close shave with this unit expect to work at it, AND expect to go over the same area in different directions.  The ""bar"" shaver is just designed that way, YOU provide the attack path on your beard.  Not a bad things but certainly more work.  Expect to get your closest shave after around 5 minutes at least.The Braun is the loudest shaver of the bunch, in fact annoying to those in the house.  The motor is truley slower than the Panasonic and it shows. It's a clunky unit to hold by comparison to the Norelco, and the Panasonic.  BUT, it will definately shave closer than ANY Norelco to date.Cleaning unit is big bulky and loud but does a very good job.  The replacement cleaner tanks are WAY overpriced compared to the others.THE PANASONIC VORTEX NANO SYSTEM.I happen to have bought mine from Brookstone, and yes I paid a $50 premium to have their special color (a light beige/silver) with wood grain finger rests and a backlight LCD.  It also has the SMALLEST cleaning unit that matches the color of the shaver and is attractive. This keeps my wife happy since it's not a lot of clutter, these cleaning units need to stay put.  THE TRUE TEST OF A CLOSER SHAVE AMOUNGST UNITSThere really is only one way to test the units - shave 1/2 of your face with one unit, the other 1/2 with a different shaver.  I did this for many weeks. Almost any shaver is going to feel pretty smooth after you first shave, you'll quickly notice which side was closer by the end of the day OR the next morning.ANOTHER GREAT TEST - I did this too!Shave your face with one brand, then immediately shave your face again with another unit. I WILL ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE THAT THESE PANASONIC VORTEX NANO'S WILL SHAVE YOU EVEN CLOSER AFTER A SHAVE FROM ANOTHER. You will notice this by the ""sound"" of your beard being cut.  It's absolutely amazing!!!DESIGN AND ENGINEERING WINS ON THE PANASONICTHREE technologies seem to be completely advanced on the Panasonic as compared to anyone else.  They are MOTOR SPEED, 30 DEGREE BLADE ANGLE AND NANO BLADE SHARPENING.  Here are my results:1. Fastest Linear motor 13,000 rpm patented, it makes a BIG difference.2. Super quiet compared to the Braun and about the same as Norelco3. The entire head goes IN and OUT and pivots LEFT to RIGHT.  This is great because you can push in harder without fear of ruining the cutter foil or nicking yourself.4. The cutter head is slightly ""curved"" which makes a BIG differnce when moving in a circular attack.5. NO vibration incredibly at that speed, and comfortable to hold6. Cleaning unit is small fast and efficient.  Uses WATER in a much larger tank than anyone else and CLEANING detergent cartridge that's a lot less money than anyones.  Hey, anyone can sell you alchohol in a cartridge, this is MUCH smarter, cleaner, and more economical.7. While on the road, you can clean the unit by simply pumping ordinary liquid soap onto the head while it's running, let it suds up, then rinse off and let dry.  How cool is that!8. YES, it can be used in the shower if you want.  These units are WELL sealed and WELL madeWell, I hope that helps you save time and money.  You could easily get this same unit from Amazon under a different model just make sure it has the following:1. Nano Blade Technology - a much sharper polishing system for their blades2.

I wanted a baby book that would give me a topic and let me journal about it without too much prompting.  There are a few fill-in pages (see below), but for the most part I can write my feelings and thoughts about my baby in my own words. This seems like a much more personal approach, and one I think my son will appreciate more when he is old enough to read it, than fill in the blank pages. A previous reviewer complained that the pages are thin and newspaper-like.  True, they are simple white pages with black titles, but the pages themselves are not at all flimsy--thicker than the average novel page and more like lightweight cardstock.  The illustrations are small, simple, and non-intrusive.  Black and white line drawings that are more iconic than a cutesy.  My only complaint about this baby book is that I would like more topics (birth story, tooth chart, food, favorite expressions, favorite toys/games. . .)  However, the pages look like they are about 11"" x 8.5"" and it is bound with ribbon, so I think with a little creativity, cardstock and a hole punch I may be able to add my own pages.The topics that are covered are (with one full page allowed per topic):Baby's Name (fill in the blanks)Family Tree (line illustration & fill in the blanks)All About MomAll About DadExpectationsParties & Showers (2 pages)First ImpressionsBirth CertificateHandprintsFootprintsLock of HairVisitors & GiftsFirst Family PhotoFirsts (fill in the blanks)Baby's Favorite ThingsDoctor VisitsGrowth Chart (fill in the blanks)Medical Records (fill in the blanks)First BirthdaySecond BirthdayThird BirthdayFirst VacationHolidays & CelebrationsLetter From MomLetter From DadKeepsakesReflections There is also a small pouch for baby's first haircut, and pockets in the back to store cards, documents and other loose memorabilia",4.0,positive

I find that only after using it two or three times, I can stop... sometimes for weeks, sometimes for months, without reacurring dandruff!

I wanted a baby book that would give me a topic and let me journal about it without too much prompting.  There are a few fill-in pages (see below), but for the most part I can write my feelings and thoughts about my baby in my own words.

A previous reviewer complained that the pages are thin and newspaper-like.  True, they are simple white pages with black titles, but the pages themselves are not at all flimsy--thicker than the average novel page and more like lightweight cardstock.  The illustrations are small, simple, and non-intrusive.  Black and white line drawings that are more iconic than a cutesy.  My only complaint about this baby book is that I would like more topics (birth story, tooth chart, food, favorite expressions, favorite toys/games. . .)

360,B00006AMSM:has_its_drawbacks_but_worth_it:hoosier_grad,"This is my second Braun shaver. The first one was the lowest model with one blade. I loved them becuase I never cut my face with their foil design. The newer one is definitely superior with its design though. Two blades make it faster to shave. It's washable, and has a longer run with one charge. It's not too noisy so that I don't wake up the whole house. It has a sturdy and compact travel box. Carrying the charging cable is not a big problem since it's also very compact. Moreover it's not necessary to take the cable most of the times, since one charge will most likely last longer than your trip.However the Braun design has some limitations. First of all, foils are not that sturdy. They can bend and lose form if you are not careful in where you put the shaver and it falls into the sink for instance. The nice thing is that the replacement foils are available everywhere, and are affordable. Another problem with the foil design is that it's extremely hard to shave if your face is moist. You'll have to wait for the bathroom to dry up if you want to shave after the shower, since the water vapor will stick to your face otherwise. Even more important (now I am re-experiencing, as every year), in a humid summer day you will need to push the shaver to your face, since there's no way to dry the skin. Maybe it's better to fall back to traditional razor in such days, but I hate cutting myself so I just stay with my Braun.All put aside, I find one thing awkward. The small button that pops the foil for cleaning is placed just a bit above the on/off button. And sometimes (when I'm not fully awake) I accidentally push it to see the foil hit to the sink. So far (after 3 years) nothing has happened to the foil because of this, since it's extremely light. But it's still not the best placement of buttons. The trimmer has worked fine for me. Many people are complaining about it. So I'll try to complain too. The only thing I don't like about the trimmer is that the space between the trimmer and shaver is hard to reach with the brush for cleaning. I guess I am being too picky with this last comment.To sum up, I love my Braun shaver. It has been reliable for a long time. I'd give 4.5 stars if it were possible",4.0,positive

383,B00080M29Y:everyone_should_read_this......:t._myers,"Unfortunately, millions of Americans currently suffer from the debilitating effects of stress, anxiety, and depression. In the pharmaceutical industry, anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants are among the best-selling medications on the market.The everyday stressors faced by Americans have simply become too much for many to bear, and reasonably so. In recent years, taking an anti-anxiety medication or antidepressant has become as common as taking a multivitamin. However, the side effects and long-term effects of such medications were for the most part unknown until recently.In the past year, some of the drastic negative effects of such medications have come to light, much to the horror of patients and physicians alike. Anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants have been linked to addiction, severe withdrawal, weight gain, vertigo, and even suicide and death. To treat the symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression, without negative health implications, many are now turning to natural supplements -- safely and with much success.Most consumers are confused about which natural stress, anxiety, and depression supplements to take. Fortunately, there are now a few promising natural supplements on the market which offer truly effective results, safely. The challenge lies in distinguishing the effective products from the one's that are based more on marketing hype. It is critical that the product you choose contains those ingredients proven effective for treatment through clinical study, and that those ingredients are of the highest grade and included in the proper dosage in the product. This is the key to getting the results you desire - freedom from stress, anxiety, and depression.After researching nearly every available natural anxiety product on the market today I can tell you that many products contain low-grade ingredients in amounts far too small to be truly effective. There are a few, however, with clinical research behind them that also contain quality ingredients in efficacious doses.These products offer the definite potential to counter your emotional and physical responses to stress, anxiety, and depression. After review of the products and the available scientific literature only those products that met the criteria were recommended, Here is a list of the Top The Top 10 Stress, Anxiety and Depression Supplements On The Market Today:1) Anxietol 7(tm)2) Welatonin(tm)3) Pinadol(tm) 4) Seredyn(tm)5) Prosera(tm) 6) Amoryn(tm) 7) Euphorx(tm)8) HerbVal Supra(tm) 9) Clarocet-NRI(tm) 10) Relora(tm)Tess is a contributing consultant, columnist, and writer for various health, fitness. and medical publications.

410,B000FKGRXO:food_temptation?_not_here!:stellanima,"I like the Green Tea Diet pill for many reasons. First, it causes the bored eater (that'd be me) from eating aimlessly throughout the day. Secondly, since I've taken it for the 2 and half months that I have (actually this started happening within a few weeks and has continued), the capsules have helped shrink my stomach to probably half of what it used to be, so that when I do eat, I don't overdo it. Keep in mind that when I say stomach, I mean the one your food drops into, not your waistline. However, by no means am I saying that there's no weightless physically. There is! So far I've lost 15 pounds. Some of you might be thinking, ""Well that's surely with exercise, and I'm not one to have time to do that, or I hate exercising."" You know what? For those of you that DO exercise you'll lose even more weight than me at the 2.5 month mark, because I go about day to day doing general stuff, nothing like walking or jogging for miles or riding a bike. However, I've figured a few things are key to those that aren't too keen on exercise (the word alone makes me shudder).If you don't have time to exercise routinely or for very long, or you just hate the word ""exercise"" (I know it can cause terror within a few of us, don't lie) then keep these things in mind when you take this amazing pill:-Going to the grocery store? Don't go when you're hungry and don't park in the closest to the building spot (unless it's dark then it can be scary). For obvious reasons, don't go when you're hungry, you'll just end up popping everything into your cart (some stuff you don't even know what the heck it is when you get home to unpack). Instead, and I'm sure you know this, maybe go after dinner or after lunch. What to get? That's another few paragraphs down.-Going shopping? Does that word make you giddy with delight?...only until you realize you really don't have the money to be doing it? Alright, here's the solution. Go to the mall or outlet stores or wherever else it is you could spend hours looking around at stuff. Park in the furthest from the building spot, leave the tempting ways of payment either at home or in your car (hidden with stealth!), go in the building and window shop! Spend at least a half hour doing this to however long (though you'll get kicked out if you try to stay past closing time). If you think it's weird to exercise in the mall/store, it's really not. I know I've seen a few power walkers in my mall and it's totally obvious what they're doing, but the thing is you DON'T have to do that. Exercising this way is as easy as just browsing stores, circulating the mall, bypassing the food court (unless you need water) and checking out potential Christmas gifts while getting a regular workout!-Play with your kids for at least a half hour a day (outside)! Play hide and seek! Run after them! Shoot hoops (not only is it exercise, it's helping hand-eye coordination!), throw a few balls, kick a soccer ball, play on the swing set, walk around the park while your kids play! There's so many great activities and family bonding time you can do and get an easy workout, too! It's a win-win for both you and your kids.-No kids? Pets are the next best thing. I have three dogs and one cat. They're the sweetest, most evil things in the entire world! Not only do they make me take a run for my money (literally, cause they steal my shoes and anything else they can get and take outside) they also warm my heart and make me laugh and smile. 30 minutes playing with your pets is a another great way to help amplify the effects of this diet pill!-Have a good laugh. Find your funny friends, people, and laugh as much as you can! You lose loads of calories that way!There's definitely more small things that can help you lose weight, especially when taking this pill, but what about what food is right?Stay away from carbs. Period. They are not your friend all the time. Especially since they let lose all the things your fatty cells need to keep their greedy little lives prosperous in your thighs/stomach etc. Must have them? I know your pain. Instead start getting used to whole grain and wheat. Don't shrink in terror, it's not that bad! Eating habits, especially the bad ones need to be rethought when taking this pill for the best results!Well, that's my review, and a little of what I've done to help you get on your way to a better, happier, healthier you! I hope this has helped at least some people! This is how it worked for me, but keep in mind, every one's body is unique and special and has it's own way it likes losing weight, so just find that niche and you're good to go!GOOD LUCK!!",5.0,positive

The seeds contain fatty oils called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid. ALA is the omega-3 oil in flaxseed. Flaxseed contains both omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids. Flaxseed is nature's richest storehouse of omega-3 fatty acids, and contains more than twice as much omega-3 oil as fish oils, and it costs less , ounce for ounce. Flax also contains other important substances like lignans, which may protect against some types of cancer. The husks of the seeds are rich in mucilage. Both the seed oil and mucilage have many nutritional and therapeutic properties. There are many potential benefits from taking Flax seed oil:Flaxseed Oil lowers cholesterol levels, thereby improving cardiovascular health and lessening the risk of arteriosclerosis. Flaxseed also contains plant nutrients like phytoestrogens. These are natural estrogen-like substances that can lessen the discomfort of menopause.Flaxseed oil may lower high blood pressure.Flaxseed oil helps some people improve their psoriasis and eczema, as it has anti-inflammatory properties. Flaxseed may also reduce the itching, swelling, and redness associated with certain skin disorders such as acne.Flaxseed oil has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis due to its ability to calm inflammation. Flaxseed reduces LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (the body's ""bad cholesterol"") and lowers triglyceride levels. Research shows that flaxseed oil gives much better protection against heart attacks than canola oil or olive oil. Taking flaxseed may reduce cancer risk. This is because flaxseed contains the richest sources of lignan building blocks, which play a major role in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer. New research indicates that the lignans in flaxseed have both short-term and long-term protective effects against colon cancer. It is always important to purchase you Flaxseed Oil from a well-known reputable company. One tip: keep your flaxseed oil away from light and heat, as both degrade the oil.  If you purchase a bottle of flaxseed oil, make sure to refridgerate it after opening.   The usual beneficial dose of Flaxseed Oil is 2-3 grams once per day taken with a meal.  The benefits of Flaxseed Oil are cumulative.  Commit to taking it every day without fail.  Like any herbal supplement, don't expect dramatic quick results.  The results you get will be subtle at first and then build over time.  For specific conditions such as Rhematoid arthritis, exzema, psoriasis, acne, etc,. the results should be apparent in 4-8 weeks.  Be patient!

456,"B000AYYK5M:mabis_and_sinus:johnny_""jr""","Wonderful inhalation steamer for sinus conditions. I have been plagued with bad chronic sinus conditions for the past 16 years and have been miserable. Four surgeries and still problems. Countless antibiotics, steroid sprays and tablets, etc. Daily treatments morning and evening with the Mabis and the use of NeilMed sinus rinse saline packets has finally given me my life back to a quite productive state again. The Mabis puts out the very necessary copious amounts of steam where other steamers I have owned have failed. The key is that the Mabis concentrates the steam where necessary, into the nasal passages via the small nasal mask. However, it would be an improvement if Mabis would provide a nasal adapter (such as nebulizers have)that directs the steam straight into the nostrils  instead of the the small mask which allows the steam to affect the entire nose area. The angled chimney of the inhaler makes it easier to use. However, it too could be improved by the use of a flexible tube or at least have a little more angle so the unit can be easier to use while sitting upright instead of having to hunch over. They should also include more than one misting orifice because saline mixes and hard water will tend to clog the very tiny hole in the mister. Mabis does supply a small cleaning tool (a wire) to ream out a clogged orifice. If you have significant sinus trouble this unit is the best thing you will find. I have used several different devices including the KAZ (no longer made), Vicks (too little steam and not effective, facial type rather than a sinus  device). Vicks vaporizer with use of a towel(works but is very hot and brutal on the face). I have used essential oils like cinnamon, clove, thyme, tea tree in the Kaz unit and obtained some relief but the Mabis and saline mix really has been the most beneficial. It doesn't cure anything but it sure brings some quality of life back. I can't recommend this device enough. It is very portable and can be easily packed and taken on trips. I used it in my van with an inverter on a recent long trip which was very convenient. I also use it in my sailboat. It utilizes a very small amount of water which makes it simple to use in a mobile fashion. It is easy to clean as well. I suffer 24/7 with chronic sinus, been to countless doctors, taken all types of meds, had multiple surgeries and this little machine at a tiny fraction of the cost has been a big player in my regaining some quality of life. The NeilMed sailine packets are convenient and work well with the unit, I use about a third of a packet with each Mabis session. I have no interest whatsoever with Neilmed. It's just a convenient sailine product I found at the drugstore and it has helped, so you should know about it. The Mabis is the best steamer you will ever use,   don't waste your $$$ on the other feeble steamers like I did.",5.0,positive

The vacuum got all the hair which is a good thing, because I cut his hair wherever he happen to be in the house. He didn't have to stop what he was doing and sit still or wear a cape, which he hates. Having his hair cut at home also allowed him to get familiar with the trimmer--what it sounds like, and feel like-- in his own time and environment. He cut his stuffed bear's hair first, then daddy's, then his own by himself and then let me cut his. What a relief to have a nice haircut and no kicking or screaming.

I've been looking at getting a small clipper for years and finally broke down and got this. It's fantastic! It's small, light and cordless (runs on AA battery.) The clipper blade has finely spaced teeth making it ideal for fussing around lips, eyes and toes. As the description says, this is not for body clipping... you still have to drag out the monster for that, but for the details it's perfect. This would also be super for anyone who wants to keep their poodle looking neat between trips to the groomer. You have to be a little careful to avoid razorburn even with these fine teeth but nothing like a regular clipper where you can easily cut the skin pretty badly. Best of all, it's so small  you can tuck it in the bathroom drawer for quick trim ups and take it outside so the hair doesn't get all over your house. For dogs who are impatient with long grooming sessions, pulling this clipper out for five minute sessions over a period of time is a snap. Did I mention the low price? I don't see a downside to this clipper for what it is. The body is regular grade plastic but the blade is very nice, and a snap on cap protects it in the drawer.

I was so fed up with my hair style that when I went to the salon a few months ago, my stylist recommended this flat iron to me.  I had tried in the past to straighten my hair at home with various other flat irons (with harsh metal plates) and round-brush-hairdryer combinations, but to no avail.  I'm happy to say that the Vidal Sassoon Professional High-Heat Hair Straightener has lived up to its reputation by straightening my hair, changing my style, making my hair more managable, and continuing to demonstrate high quality in its design.The highlight of this straightener is its 2 1/4-inch ceramic plates coated in gold.  The plates heat my hair from the inside to the out, creating smooth hair void of frizzies.  The straightener also boasts a 60-second heat up feature and has 25 heat settings to accomodate any hair type.  All you simply do is plug the unit in, turn the switch to on, set the heat level, and that's it!  The 170 watts pack enough punch to cut down on styling time, as well.  The unit's cord is short enough that it doesn't wrap up in a gigantic knot, but is long enough to move around my bathroom while I work on my hair.  The flat iron is also extremely compact: when finished, and after it has cooled off, I simply wrap the cord around it and store in a bathroom drawer.  It also fits easily into my suitcase when traveling.  Finally, maintenance of this flat iron is very easy.  Whenever the plates or outside handles become sticky with gel or hairspray, I simply wipe it off with a wet cloth.Overall, I am very pleased with this straightener.  I have not had any problems with the gold coating flaking off or the unit burning up.  I like how the flat iron doesn't dry out my hair and that my style stays straight throughout the day and into the evening (rarely any frizzies).  In all honesty, the iron works so well that it only takes me about 20 minutes to style my hair in the morning.

However, I've noticed that when I'm actively working around a project and getting myself in different positions related to the object of my work, the glasses often separate where the magnets are positioned in the bridge of the glasses causing me to have to clear both hands of tools or whatever are in them to reconnect the lenses.  It is exasperating, but you've got to be able to see your work.  This design flaw in the product clearly doesn't apply to most people's situation.  Some might argue that my head is just too big!  While I may have a big ego, my head is actually slightly smaller than average.  This problem could likely be corrected by the manufacturer by extending each temple about one inch to give the glasses more room to expand before breaking apart.  But the important thing for you to know is that I'd still buy these glasses all over again.  They really are terrific",4.0,positive

I've given up trying other bars that are mostly disappointingly filled with all sorts of oils I can't eat. Take cottonseed for example it is in everything! Not to mention, peanut butter and all the palm kernel oil saturating the health bar market. The ingredients in the Carrot Cake Bar: Organic Brown Rice Syrup, Soy Protein Isolate, Rice Flour, Malt Extract, Organic Soy Flour, Organic Roasted Soybeans, Organic Rolled Oats, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Dried Apples, Cocoa Butter, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors, Apple Fiber, Oat Fiber, Organic Milled Flaxseed, Chicory Extract, Psyllium, Organic soy Butter, Dried Carrots, Raisins, Coconut, Sea Salt, Nutmeg, Cinnamon and Cloves. Each bar is 240 Calories and is delicious for breakfast with a cup of tea. I eat a Clif Bar almost every morning and never really feel overly hungry during the day. Gary (The Owner of Clif Bar Inc.) seems to have also found out that ""other"" energy bars were not really that tasty. After his ""epiphany,"" he spent lots of time in his Mom's kitchen working on making cliff bars. What a guy! I was at the point where I was trying to make my own granola bars, but after discovering these bars, I'm hooked. They are portable, delicious and basically, I love all the flavors. You can take them biking, hiking, walking, anywhere. This bar is especially delicious and I seem to fall in love with it again each October. Must be the spices and the creamy white chocolate chips. There are just enough chocolate chips to remind you of cream cheese icing. If I had to choose between a piece of carrot cake and one of these bars, the bar would win. Also look for the Cranberry Apple Cherry Bars and the Pumpkin Spice Bars. ~TheRebeccaReview.com",5.0,positive

I have previously owned Norelcos for over a decade. The original Norelcos (made in Holland) were fine but the recent ones have pathetic quality and they literally pull hair! It is painful! I eventually gave up trying to use my replacement lift-and-cut Norelco and decided to try out a high end model that cost close to two hundred dollars. Bad idea - you don't always get what you pay for! I was not quite happy with that either and after a two year haitus with disposable Gillettes, decided to try a wet shaver. I took my chance on this one, based solely on the reviews here. This is the very first ""wet"" shaver I've used and absolutely love it. It gives a close enough shave but not too close. You can use it with whatever shaving cream you use. Note that the Panasonic manual encourages using the cheapest foam type (not gel), Barbasol like stuff with this shaver. It also comes with a basic carrying pouch and the cleaning is as easy as it can get (just wash the thing under tap water). They really meant that this unit is washable. It is recharagable, lasts seven days on a charge, and costs less than replacement blades for competing brands. The build quality is excellent. The charger is a very clever design that gets the shaver completely off your counter space. You cannot go wrong with this. Amazon has a great value here.

My first few times meditating(before I purchased this game) were great...but then, it became harder and harder to achieve the original calm after that, not only that, it took longer and longer to achieve even the slightest amount of relaxation. Then out of desperation, because my anxiety and self-consciousness were once again running and ruining my life, I bought this game. Now I am always relaxed and I can reach calm in minutes and stay focused for hours throughtout the day. It is amazing how the biofeedback, music and interest in trying to play the game can be so effective...again you will be amazed. However, I did struggle the first few times trying to get into a groove, but once you hit that groove it stays around and is easy to obtain. I would say that it probably took me about 2 hours to hit my first state of calmness. That sounds like a long time and it is, but the game and the biofeedback make the time pass.The second time playing I was already calm and moved through the game rather quickly. The third time and beyond I am able to succeed at the challenges pretty quickly compared to the first time. I am always calm now..which is a wierd experience for me..and always feel focused. Even little babies and animals come up to me now...just kidding.  For type A personalities I would just read the comments and lower your expectations for how fast you should succeed at this game. You will definitely need patience, but once you are calm..the pace of the game is just perfect. The frustration and patience will be worth it.

My plan was to buy the Braun, use it for 30 days, return it and then give the Panasonic a try for the next 30 days, and then choose the one I liked most.Let me put it this way, I know it takes the skin 2-4 weeks to get used to a new shaving system; I have owned the Braun for a total of THREE DAYS (that's right, 3 shaves) and I can honestly tell you that I will NOT be returning it, and not even thinking about trying out the Panasonic. This is the best shave I have ever had in my life, period!  The first shave wasn't as close as I was expecting, but after running it through the cleaning system, the next two shaves were spectacular... close, smooth and not one bit of irritation!Oh, and don't pay attention to those who complain about the cleaning station being loud...

Like other reviewers I think on the legs and armpits it works best in the shower when you are nice and lathered up with soap - the lather helps get rid of the friction as the head moves over the skin and it's a much smoother shave.  I found that without lather the movement was somewhat jerky, the head didn't slide over the skin and smoothly and it was more painful.On the legs and especially the shins, it's still painful although not as painful as another epilator I had tried.  It works absolutely great (when lathered up) on the armpits.  I did both of them quickly, completely and with very little pain - I think your armpits must be less sensitive.I did my bikini area - again definately works better and hurts less when your skin is lathered up.  I do have to say that this was a definately painful process.  While it still works great on this area, I think waxing may stil be best for a couple reasons.  1) Waxing does the whole area in one fell swoop and therefore you are only in pain for a moment as opposed to several minutes with the epilator; because your bikini line is so sensitive, this makes a big difference.  2) It is nearly impossible to epilate a ""shape"" to your grooming because of the bulkiness of the head.  Unless you're removing all hair it would be difficult to do just a certain area.  (For this reason I gave four stars not five)I happend to have a few mutant hairs on my chin that I have to pluck every now and again; just for giggles I tried it on my face (dry).  It worked AWESOME.  I ran over my chin a only a couple times and it got even the smallest thinest hairs you couldn't really see.Overall great product but not the best for bikini area",4.0,positive

753,B00006K0X1:very_close_and_comfortable_shave:m._groves,"I'm almost 50 and have been using an electric razor most of my shaving life. When my trusty Norelco needed replacing, my wife bought me the latest self-cleaning Braun for a Christmas gift. I liked some aspects of it, but it always had a hard time shaving my neck area without going back over it a lot of times. Replacing the cutter and screen every 6 months or so helped keep it from getting progressively worse, but after a couple of years, I thought I would try something different.I read MANY reviews and decided to try the Norelco Spectra system. I've been using it for several months now and I can tell you the difference on my neck is like night and day. The Norelco is MUCH faster and smoother than the Braun and cuts very close after only a couple of passes. I was amazed at how much better it was than even my old triple-head Norelco.If I were to have ANY negative, it would be the charging system. The first problem is, if you provide a recharging ""stand"", then the logic (IMO) should be that the stand be allowed to be plugged in 24/7 with the razor in it, without any adverse affects. However, MANY places in the manual tell you DOING THIS WILL SHORTEN THE LIFE OF YOUR BATTERY.Because they use a NiCad battery, they ask that you only recharge it when it runs low to avoid the ""memory"" effect and associated diminished capacity. I can understand that, but the second problem is, it gets fully charged in only 4 hours! After that, you are supposed to remove it from, or unplug, the stand to avoid overcharging. Unfortunately, most of us shave in the morning before a work day, then don't return for at least 9-10 hours. In my case, a 12 or even 24 hour charge would be far more convenient. What's so hot about a ""4-hour charge"" anyway?? OK, how about I push a button to start the charge cycle, and it automatically shuts off when fully charged! How easy is that? (Gee, that's exactly how my Braun worked.)Being an Electrical Engineer myself, I'm sometimes overly critical of things like this. OK, if it were me, (are you listening Norelco???) I would have used a NiMH battery that didn't have to be ""deep cycled"", then use a lower current ""trickle charge"" base that could be left on 24/7. A side benefit is when you pack for a trip and grab your razor, you KNOW it's always 100% charged and will probably have enough juice to last the entire trip without dragging the charger along.OK, maybe the charger is not as bad as I make it out to be. I just think it could be better. I give it 3 stars, while the razor itself gets a full 5 stars",4.0,positive

I tried the Mach 3 a few different times over the years but all it would take was just one shave and, boom!, my face would break out with folliculitis. Although Gillette claims the Mach 3 reduces irritation, I always found it super irritating. Two things seem different about the Fusion. The closer spacing of the blades seems genuinely to reduce the irritation I found in the Mach 3. The Mach 3 always seemed to dig into my face and scrape away layers of skin. Not so with the Fusion! Second, it seems to me that the way that the Fusion shaver cartridge is mounted to the handle makes for a better angle of shave. I haven't noticed that Gillette makes any claim that the way the Fusion's blade is mounted is any different from the Mach 3, but still, I think it is slightly different. I always felt like the leading edge of the Mach 3 shaver cartridge had too sharp an angle against my skin. It seems like the Fusion avoids this by mounting the ""hinge"" farther back on the shaving cartridge. Thus, the rubber fins in front of the blades makes the cartridge ride more level or flat over the face. Truly an improvement however it was achieved! Also, before I used the Fusion, I thought five blades were a little ridiculous. I figured you could never get close in front of the ears, under the nose, etc. However, I have found that five blades aren't ridiculous. The special trimmer blade is nice but I find I don't hardly need it. I can get into close spaces generally without it.In the end, I have used the Fusion and enjoyed a totally comfortable shave!

On top of that, since it's a whole food fiber, it also adds nutrition to whatever you mix it with in the form of protein, vitamins, minerals and beneficial fats from the flax seeds(omega 3). The best part about this is that it doesn't contain Psyllium which is the 'in' fiber these days but a lot of people find that it's too harsh on the stomach and can cause constipation easily if not taken with a lot of fluids. Super Seed is much gentler than your average fiber supplement and tastes great with anything. My favorite way to use it is to add half a scoop to Lifeway's plain kefir.

The non-moldable rubber-y ones are even worse; they hurt my ears and don't block out sound very well. ""Mack's earpillows"" are waterproof, so you can swim without getting water in your ears.

The only drawbacks that I know are the fact that they don't kill all noise (nothing does that), and they don't last forever (nothing does that either.)  You throw them away when they get dirty, but if you keep them in the case, they'll stay clean quite a while.

I never tried to quit before LifeSign and was simply AMAZED at how well it worked. The beauty of this product is that it addresses both physical and mental sides of the smoking addiction. It weans you off physically by increasing the intervals between your cigarettes and it breaks your mental patterns by not letting you smoke at your usual pattern, but rather at scheduled times. That really breaks the craving pattern! And the whole thing is CUSTOMIZED directly to you, vs a standard fits-all approach of other programs. And it does NOT use any drugs!!! It's completely natural! The little machine calculates your patterns and the strength of addiction (how many cigs you smoke) and then comes up with the program tailored to just you. It even allows for ""cheating""! If you can't follow the quitting program and keep cheating, all you have to do is keep pressing that button when you smoke, and the machine will adjust your program! To make a long story short, it took me 19 days to quit a 10 year old habit! 7 days for recording my patterns and 12 to quit. Since I quit I have not had a cigarette in over three years!

This being said, I am completely in love with this product and feel it has helped boost my immune system 100%.Unfortunately, I am not as health-conscious as I should be.  I am overweight, have a bit of an addiction to McDonald's cheeseburgers, and maybe exercise once or twice a week.  It all seemed to catch up with me last Thanksgiving when I got hit with a cold.  No big deal, I get them a couple of times a year.  Then, right before Christmas, I got another cold.  I was very put-out, but just figured it was my bad luck.  February rolls around and brings with it Cold #3.  I had missed quite a bit of work and was getting very concerned that something else might be wrong.  I developed a slight fever, but it all went away in one week.  I hoped that it was all over and I had just had an unfortunate cold season.  When I got back to work, I spoke with one of my co-workers, ""Emily,"" who is a self-proclaimed health-nut.  She would always brag that she ""never got colds.""  I would cringe and tell her to a) not tempt fate and b) stop rubbing it in.  She swore by this ""green food"" powder she drank every day in her lemonade.  It looked like finely cut grass, and I assumed that's what it was.  I told her she was nuts, she hadn't gotten a cold because she was lucky, she ate really well, and ran every morning.  I let her fix me some of the powder and tried to mix it up with my tea.  It was horribly, it felt like I was drinking, well, finely cut grass.  It didn't have a bad taste, but the texture was grotesque.  I told her I'd take my chances.Well, Here comes March and, with it, a new cold.  By this time I was desperate.  Emily told me to go to the health store and look for some of the green foods in capsule form.  I did so, and although I couldn't find the brand she was taking in capsule form (Green Vibrance), I did find the Greens Plus.  It seemed to have a lot of similar ingredients, so I went ahead and bought it ($40!).  Whatever, I figured this was my last-ditch effort before hauling myself down to the doctor.  I took 4 of the pills that night, and, I swear, woke up the next morning feeling ok.  It was like I had knocked my cold out before it really got started.  I was elated, but still not convinced.  I was sure it could have been coincidental, but after four months and four colds, I really didn't care.  I took 3 of these pills every morning (you can take up to 12), and the colds didn't come back.  Twice since then, I've felt that ""scratchy throat"" feeling you get when a cold's coming on, and I'll up my dosage to 4, twice a day.  I'm always fine the next day.  Colds are flying around my office, but Emily and I are still (knock on wood) healthy.  I've since done a little internet research on the individual ingredients, but am still not sure what it is that is helping.  Maybe it's just a placebo effect.  I haven't had any of the other benefits the product claims like increased energy, stamina, etc., but I also haven't gotten another cold.  I am a faithful believer in it now.  Maybe it's just snake oil and maybe it's all due to the placebo effect.  But seriously, I don't care.  I haven't had a cold in a while, so I'm happy as can be.

The unfortunate result of such neglect is cavities (especially in kids), and inevitable gum disease in adults, which in both cass over time leads to tooth loss.  Gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities from between the teeth is with floss.  Mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key, and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline.  The bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime.  I have heard all the excuses for not flossing: The floss is too hard to handle, my fingers turn blue, my fingers are too fat, I'm too clumsy, the floss hurts my gums, etc, etc.  This disposable flosser is great for kids, who may not have the dexterity to load a non-disposable flosser, such as the ""Flossaide Dental Floss Holder"", which I recommend for adults (see my review).    I have recommended this floss aid to my young patients over the years and I strongly recommend it to you as well.  One still has to develop the habit of flossing daily, and this device aides in the mechanics of flossing, making it a breeze.  Get it and save your teeth!Jim ""Konedog"" Koeni",5.0,positive

Last september I cut my hip length hair to mid back, and then in december to just at the shoulders, and then again to the chin in January - and from January through June I trimmed it regularly to keep it that length. (I've been getting rid of the henna that was in my hair - I couldn't get it out via any other method tried except ""growing out""). My hair grows kinda slow now too - it used to grow faster, but I suppose everything slows down the older you get.My last cut was late June - and it was at mid to upper neck length  - basically a little bit longer than the chin length cut, and then layered. That got rid of the really saturated henna'd hair - so I was ready to start growing it out. After much digging around online I came across hair 37 and all the reviews on it - both good and bad. I gave it a shot - got my pills in the first week of July and started taking them. Last night - maybe it was wishful thinking, but I noticed a difference in the hair length - it seemed it'd picked up a little length a little extra quickly - and then my boyfriend commented on it later that day. He knows I've been working to go back to my natural hair color - and there's a noticeable demarcation line from the henna and the natural hair color. Last night he looked at me and said ""Hey wow - you're hair's really grown - I can see a half inch more of the roots! Wow - you're hair is getting dark!""I was pretty pleased with that - not bad for just 2 weeks on the vitamins! I can't wait to see how it is in another 2 weeks, come August - if I have another 1/2 inch to add to it, I will definitely be reordering these pills!But a side note, from previous reviews and my own experience... it's a lot of pills to take - but make sure you keep up with them every day.

Such effects lead most consumers to believe their crow's feet are smaller. If you really want to do a test, you should stop using the product for a few days using only face wash. If during that time you observe smaller wrinkles then the product works.

Then it is consistent with the arm cuffs I also use.  It also tends to deflate a bit more quickly than I think is good for best accuracy.The big flaw, and one it shares with the Prevention DS-1902PV Arm cuff, is that while it claims to detect irreglar heartbeat, and does, it DOES NOT STORE that info in memory along with the BP & pulse, time and date.  If that info is useful to detect then it should be useful to record, and that is what I assumed it would do.I think that is a bit of misrepresentation of the product.I am also not happy with the way the information must be displayed for copying.

It really does conform to your body and limbs.  I did notice that chemical smell which went away the first day.  No biggy.  It does slip off my mattress easily.  If I fix it, it slips again the same night (not completely, just about 6"").  I didn't get the quilted cover which may prevent that from happening.  Animal hair sticks to the memory foam like glue so keep it covered.  The free pillow is very small and not useful for sleeping.  Kids could use it but I use it while watching tv - very comfy for that.  I bought the memory foam topper because I have a condition called costocondritis (inflamation of the muscles between the ribs).  My ribcage is in terrible pain at night when I'm trying to sleep.  I found that I do fine when I sleep on something soft so I thought the memory foam would help.  It really hasn't and I think it's because when I'm laying on it my weight flattens it and my surface area becomes as hard as my mattress is.  I am 100lbs overweight so I think that's why.  I think I will just have to buy a softer mattress and use this one on my hide-a-bed for my guests (oh, and lose weight!).  Still, I don't regret buying it.Bottom line, if you are heavy like me, the topper will flatten and you won't experience the memory foam softness except for on your limbs.

After a double-cycle treatment on a cyst that is just beginning under the skin, the pain goes away (yes, that means breaking the rules of the directions which say only one cycle. This works more efficiently, basically). Once done, the majority of the bacteria inside the cyst will die, causing the sequence of the cyst to stagnate and even reverse itself (often slowly, but surely). It also becomes less visually apparent, heals faster, and has a much lesser chance of leaving a scar. Thus, you can actually walk outside your home feeling a bit more confident in your appearance!

The truth is that I am not using the radio at all, mostly because I believe the batteries will last longer and it will save me from extra trips to Walmart. But I have tested it and it works, although nothing impressive there. Of course, for the money, I think you cannot go wrong with this pedometer.One funny comment is that, although most people complain it cannot open very easily, after sometime it will open more easily that you think. Actually it has been a couple of times where putting a bag on my shoulders or a waist pouch and applying some pressure on it by mistake, will open it wide, so it does not count any steps. But it does not open by itself anyway, needs external force for this to happen, so it does not happen often.All in all, I am sure that the plastic construction and the less than rigorous production testing will result in many pieces that do not function properly and will result in bad reviews.

Great idea, but the execution of the idea is not for everyone.  The back piece is also hard plastic, rigid, and if you have long hair, you have to lift them out from under your hair and place the plastic back strip at your mid-skull level, fit them on your ears and then fit the front parts together and snap.  From the back you end up looking like you are wearing an external orthodontic apparatus.  I'd like to see the company put a string in place of the hard plastic that loops around your neck.  The magnetic clip that brings the two lenses together in the front is a fabulous idea, and having the two lenses hanging off to the sides instead of a whole pair of glasses swaying across your front is so much more comfortable and out of the way - it's just the rigid frame at the back that makes me wonder if anyone really tried using these things before they were mass manufactured",2.0,negative

1304,B00080M29Y:everyone_should_read_this.....:harold_r.,"Unfortunately, millions of Americans currently suffer from the debilitating effects of stress, anxiety, and depression. In the pharmaceutical industry, anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants are among the best-selling medications on the market. The everyday stressors faced by Americans have simply become too much for many to bear, and reasonably so. In recent years, taking an anti-anxiety medication or antidepressant has become as common as taking a multivitamin. However, the side effects and long-term effects of such medications were for the most part unknown until recently. In the past year, some of the drastic negative effects of such medications have come to light, much to the horror of patients and physicians alike. Anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants have been linked to addiction, severe withdrawal, weight gain, vertigo, and even suicide and death. To treat the symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression, without negative health implications, many are now turning to natural supplements -- safely and with much success. Most consumers are confused about which natural stress, anxiety, and depression supplements to take. Fortunately, there are now a few promising natural supplements on the market which offer truly effective results, safely. The challenge lies in distinguishing the effective products from the one's that are based more on marketing hype. It is critical that the product you choose contains those ingredients proven effective for treatment through clinical study, and that those ingredients are of the highest grade and included in the proper dosage in the product. This is the key to getting the results you desire - freedom from stress, anxiety, and depression. After researching nearly every available natural anxiety product on the market today I can tell you that many products contain low-grade ingredients in amounts far too small to be truly effective. There are a few, however, with clinical research behind them that also contain quality ingredients in efficacious doses. These products offer the definite potential to counter your emotional and physical responses to stress, anxiety, and depression. After review of the products and the available scientific literature only those products that met the criteria were recommended, Here is a list of the Top The Top 10 Stress, Anxiety and Depression Supplements On The Market Today: 1) Anxietol 7(tm) 2) Welatonin(tm) 3) Pinadol(tm) 4) Seredyn(tm) 5) Prosera(tm) 6) Amoryn(tm) 7) Euphorx(tm) 8) HerbVal Supra(tm) 9) Clarocet-NRI(tm) 10) Relora(tm)",5.0,positive

I could only put a VERY small section of hair around the roller if I had any hope of it staying put on my head.  Most of the time the clips would pop off and the roller would fall out if I so much as turned my head.Remington has another set of compact express rollers called ""All That"", which are almost identical in function, only they come with pins instead of the clips.  If you're looking for something quality, compact and easy to use that will stay in your hair until YOU'RE ready to take them out, I'd recommend that set instead of this one",1.0,negative
1326,458039,"Although I have used many electronic cuff devices in the past, this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings.      Firstly, the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way.       In a clinical setting, it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings. It is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement. I have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what I considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way. Imagine had I taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result.     As a rule, I never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings. Many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security.     If you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting, please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions.",2.0,negative

Even the price was attractive. It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus. I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly. Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers. When I've replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  I'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer's lifespan.  I've now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan.",1.0,negative

1395,154975,"I drink a lot of bottled water. It does NOT make me feel full - sometimes quite the opposite. Of course, drinking water before or during the meal lessens the chance of overeating, but the effect of the Skinny water goes beyond that. I love its taste because it is not overbearing and too sweet like other citrus-flavored water I've tried. It replaces my soda and curbes my apetite pretty well. I also bought a bottle for a friend of mine. He was wondering why he wasn't getting hungry for a long time, and only later realized it must have been the Skinny water. It costs quite a bit. However, bunch of drinks cost about the same and have negative impact on your body. So, even if this is a placebo effect (and, fankly, I don't care as long as it works), I think it's worth it.

I can't afford three bottles a day, but will buy this water sporadically, most likely from my local 7-11.I would like to point out that most of the people who wrote negative reviews here either didn't like the TASTE of the water, or NEVER TASTED it in the first place.

1397,13552,"This is a well-made device of useful, though limited, value. It's usefulness derives from its consistency, which is amazing. Given that your body composition varies throughout the day, particularly your level of hydration, the Omron measurements vary by only fractions of a percent - exactly what you would expect.It measures small electric currents running from one electrode, through your body, to the second electrode. The Omron is programmed to estimate your body fat by measuring the impedance of your body to the flow of electricity. So, one might think that such a measurement would be straightforward, like on a weight scale. Electricity encounters fat, muscle, bone, and fluids and the Omron interprets the current and displays your body fat percent. Right? After all, when you step on a scale, the scale responds by showing your weight. You don't need to tell the scale whether you think you are an athlete or how old you are. It simply measures your weight. Well, the Omron doesn't work that way, nor do other similar devices, nor do skin-fold calipers. It looks to me as though electrical and skin-fold devices all simply measure surface body fat. Then they require that you input other data, such as your activity level (""normal"" or ""athlete"" in the Omron case) and age. This is not good because it introduces general population averages into what should be specific measurements of YOU. For instance, regardless of your body, it is assumed that the older you are, the more internal fat you have. The resulting body fat estimates are dramatically different when factoring in those variables.The Omron (and calipers) is still useful, though, if you consider it to be a compass rather than a scale. You can't be sure that it can tell you where you are, but, over time, it can tell you where you are going.",4.0,positive

1400,325195,"When I go out at nights I meet a lot of people. I like to be the centre of attention, which means I have to be louder and more fun than the DJ, the music, the flashing lights and everyone else in the places I go to. Its a lot of fun but drains my energy. I often find myself crashing half way through the night. I run out of steam, feeling hungry, dizzy and (worst of all) I loose my spark. The only thing to then is to leave and grab a bite to eat. Typically I feel bloated and sleepy then. So I'll often call it a night. The fun is over - which sucks!I needed a different way to do things. I experimented with candy bars, oatmeal bars and energy bars. None of them worked - they just delayed the crash a little. The Hooah bar was the last one I tried. I say it was the last one, because once I tried this I realised I didn't need anything else. I tried it out on my birthday. I have to admit the whole ""developped by the military"" thing made me curious. But after failing with all the other bars I didn't have high hopes. I took two bars with me that night. Around midnight the familiar signs that I had depleted my energy stores started showing: I felt a little dizzy, I got a few hot & cold flushes, my stomach felt like it was going eat itself soon. The thing is I was having far too good a time to leave (I had a party of 7 people hanging on my every word - something which does tremendous things to boosting the old ego!) Instead of bailing - as I might have done, I just popped open the Hooah bar and ate it as I carried on.Within minutes my hunger pangs disappeared, my blood sugar levels balanced out and I felt back on form.

The contacts are extremely comfortable and there is no initial burning or anything that you get with some solutions.

If you are trying to decide between the Opti-Free Express and the Replenish, I would recommend the Replenish.

I had tried all the other the most expensive gels and creams on the market and still did not get any relief from canker sores. My friend pointed this product out in the drug store and the only reason I purchased it was b/c it was fairly inexpensive. I figured, why not. I came home and applied it thinking that it would probably not make a difference, just like the other products I tried. When I put it on, I stuck it to my teeth that were right by the sore. It was not very easy to keep in place at first and with a very soar canker sore, it made it kinda painful. However, after about 5minutes of moving it with my tongue to keep it in place, it stuck nicely. For about an hour after I had it in place, it was very painful. I even contemplating taking it out of my mouth because the pain wasn't going away, but this was due to me being so skeptical about any medicines working for canker sore pain. However, I kept it in my mouth and after about an hour and a half, the relief set in. I kept the disc in when I ate dinner and did not have any problems. When the disc finally disolved completely (about 8hrs after I applied it) I felt like a new person! The sore was still present but the pain that I was experiencing from it before I applied the disc was completely gone. I could actually smile without being in any pain at all. I did not sleep with one in for fear of choking on it but woke up in the morning in no pain. I applied another one in the morning so that I could ensure the pain didn't come back.

Well, I haven't lost one yet. The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing. Since I've always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I'm using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth. It's kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.

My previous one was a Braun (I prefer the single head shavers) normal dry shaver, and if I wanted a really close shave it left my skin a little sore from the extra friction.  But washing with a little soap and water just before using this shaver, I get a beard that's soften up a little by the washing, and then this shaver glides over the soapy lather like silk!!  My shave is close every time, and my face is *very* happy I found this shaver.There's a bonus for me.  It has a faint buzz you can hear over the normal hum when it's actually cutting off hairs, so I can tell when I'm shaved clean just by the sound of the shaver.  Works great for cleaning up those few die hard hairs on my balding pate where I can't see - no buzz = no stubble.I just came back to buy another one of these (to leave in my travel kit - I keep it fully equipped so I can just grab it and go).

I rely on caffeine for most of my projects at school and for late night coding sessions as well as marathon gaming. Although energy drinks can be considered a crutch, it's a lifestyle decision that many, many people embrace rather than attempt to avoid... I am one of these people.That said, Guru Energy is fairly cheap ($1.25USD/can) if you buy it here off Amazon, it comes in the Redbull standard 8.3 fl/oz cans, and is shipped in a suprisingly lightweight and compact case (compare this to Monster, Rockstar, or any other brand with standard 16 fl/oz cans).The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more ""natural""... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.I think a particular good feature of Guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup.

1656,B000GLN398:smoother-than-shaved_and_it_lasts_longer_than_shaving:southgenie,"Very few things make my list of favorites but this little item just did. This little pain-in-exchange-for-beauty-&-convenience device has several rows of tweezers, which are the metal parts in between the purple separators. They open up at the bottom and close as they come over the top while they spin around in separate directions, grabbing and tweezing out numerous hairs fairly rapidly. It has 2 operating speeds, fast or slow. (3 only if you consider OFF a speed)I'm a shaver, not a waxer, I'd estimate my pain threshold as about average, but I wouldn't so much say it hurts as much as really stings, even on my underarms, which really surprised me because I was expecting a lot of pain when using this, especially on my underarms. The more hair you have in a given region the more you pull out at the same time and naturally that hurts more than when there's fewer hairs to remove. Also, it hurts more to pull out longer than shorter hairs, I'm not sure why. It's definitely helpful to stretch the surrounding skin taut to make the hairs stand up a little, but they still don't tend to come out in one pull. It can sometimes take up to four passes with hairs coming up a little more each time until they're out. I also noticed it did better and hurt less on thicker, stronger hairs rather than finer ones; still, I was surprised at how well it worked on hairs that seemed like nothing, barely visible in the first place.  Initially you may be looking at a significant time investment to get to the point where you're as smooth as shaved, for me it was about equivalent to the time I spend in an entire week of shaving spread out over a few days. It's a really odd feeling, going from stubbly to smooth without an actual shave. I got about 3 to 4 times more hair removed than if I shaved, without nicks or cuts, giving me 3 times longer to go until I have to remove those hairs again. Six days later I went to touch up and was hard put to find anything to remove. My legs and underarms are actually smoother than when shaved and have stayed that way instead of getting stubbly within a few days, and that's why this made my list of favorite things. Now for some recommendations:Before you use this, let your hair get to a lightly stubbly but not overgrown state, once you use it you can gauge for yourself your own best level. You can start using this while the hair is still shorter than when you might normally shave, and its best that way because even though you will have to use it for a few days to get all the hair as it cycles through growth stages removing less hair at one time means less pain, and that's especially important when you're first starting out. I would also recommend showering or bathing and exfoliating the areas you plan to remove hair from first including washing off deodorant from underarms but make sure your skin is not wet or damp when you start because damp or wet skin is more pliable and that means pinching and pain during use. I have seen models that are cordless and state they can be used wet but I can't imagine why you'd want to do that since it's bound to hurt. I've run this thing for long periods of time (up to 45 minutes) but never had a problem with jamming, probably because I clean & exfoliate my skin first and clean the unit out after each use.The first few times you use this your skin may become irritated and bumpy, so I would not get this to use immediately before a big event or trip, I would want to give myself a minimum of 2 to 4 weeks to get used to it, especially since you may decide you don't like it. It takes some time to get to that as-smooth-as-shaved condition, so I would plan on using it over the course of a few days to reduce irritation and give some time for hairs to cycle through their growth stages and become long enough to remove.",5.0,positive

1660,"B0000VLXUA:centrun_silver_is_targeted_at_older_people:james_koenig_""konedog4""","Centrum-brand vitamins are made by a quality company, which is important in buying vitamins.  Since the vitamin industry is not regulated by the FDA, manufacturers can put just about anything on the label to sell their product, and many do!  Oft times the supposed ingredients are not even in the product, and this is why a name-brand product is essential.  The Centrum-brand is one that the consumer can trust. Centrum-Silver is a product targeted for adults and those older than 55 years of age.  However, this vitamin formulation can be taken by any adult with effectiveness.  Vitamins are elements and chemical compounds that help the body's cells function better, mostly in the area of cell/body metabolism.  If one eats a balanced diet high in greens and fruits, extra store-bought vitamins are probably not essential, as vitamins are supplied in adequate quantities in the food consumed.  However, the typical American diet is notorious for being high in sugars and low in veggies and fruits, therefore making supplemental vitamins important.  Diets high in sugars demand more vitamin compounds to help metabolize the sugars.  Since the average American consumes more than 110 pounds of dietary (table sugar: ,sucrose) sugars each year, supplemental vitamins are important if not essential to take on a daily basis.  When selecting a vitamin product, it is important to get the basic vitamins, such as the A's to E's, but it is also important to get the minerals and trace elements too, as these compounds and elements are essential to metabolism and cellular health of the body's various functions including the immune system.  This product has all the basics covered and more, and that is why I like it.  Most vitamin companies when formulating their vitamin compound give 100% of the RDA or more.  I am not a believer in mega-vitamins (formulations that provide many times more than the RDA) because the body can only use so much and the extra is generally excreted in the urine.  The only exception to this rule is the fat-soluble vitamins, (Vitamin A, E, and K).  Fat-soluble vitamins can be stored to excess in the body and can reach toxic levels.  With this in mind, it makes no sense to continually consume fat-soluble vitamins in excess.  One final thing: many manufacturers make claims that their vitamin product is going to make you ""feel"" better, a sensation of vitality that will be noticable.  Perhaps if you have been in a state of malnutrition for many years, this claim may be valid for some, but I have taken vitamins most of my life, and I feel about the same whether I take them or not.  Rather than judge the effectiveness of vitamins on how they ""feel"", judge them instead on knowing that you have all the bases covered in terms of cell metabolism, for once this is covered, your cells will be as healthy as nutrition can make them.

1702,B000296N4Q:some_units_are_plain_defective:konstantin,"Maybe my unit was just defective, but here's my experience with this scale:First impression: It does look beautiful. Closer inspection: Although it's a German company, the manufacturing is in China. The legs and the body are cheap plastic.After switching to pounds, I placed the scale on the floor.  With noone standing, the scale started displaying weight measurements that were quickly changing in the range from 1 to 30 lbs.  I figured it was trying to calibrate itself and zero itself out (the manual does not mention anything about calibration or zeroing the scale out, so I am not sure).  A couple of times it did display 0.0, but then it would change again.  After a couple of minutes of doing this, the scale turned off.The manual says that after programming, with the last keypress, it should show 0.0, and then you have to immediately get on the scale so it recognizes you next time.  For me, with the last keypress, it went back into ""calibration"".  To make the story short...The scale showed my weight as being from 150 to 230 lbs on different measurements!  (My real weight is around 210 lbs)At first I thought it was the problem with ""calibration"", so I tried resetting the scale and catching 0.0 reading before getting on it.  Then I tried waiting, hoping it would eventually calibrate itself, but it would always turn off with the last reading not 0.0, and depending on at what point the calibration stopped, you would get a different range of readings.  Getting on the scale, locks in the calibration, but even then on consecutive readings the measurements would vary within 15 lbs range.  According to Soehnle website, the accuracy tolerance of those scales should be within 3 increments of .2, so even assuming it was a calibration problem, the accuracy is still unacceptable.The warranty is 3 years, not 10 as stated on Amazon website.All the features that others rave about, are there (auto-on, auto-recognize your settings), just hold your fingers crossed that it's not defective.P.S.

1710,"B0009KN8JQ:great_product!:kelly_""book_worm_and_cat_lover""","I started using this product three months ago and wow what a difference!  I suffered from teenage acne which never really went away and when I hit my thirties it came back with a vengeance.  I'm 36 now and have developed VERY sensitive skin.  Never a makeup person since it makes me break out.  I even tried prescription acne medication, which never worked.  Finally took a six month treatment of pills and it cleared my skin up but it was never the same.  I don't sun worship not since a case of sun poisoning when I was 24.  I also have a fair complexion which reddens within five minutes of being outside.  I wear a hat while gardening due to the sensitive nature of my skin.  Freckles everywhere, even my arms.  I've been plagued with dry, sensitive skin and trust me over moisturizing doesn't work!  I began to use Aveeno and Biore products and got my skin under control but I was still having breakouts.  I've tried Neutrogena in the past but wasn't satisfied with the cleansers and stuff.. after reading other reviews of this product and Neutrogena Advanced Solutions I decided to try both of them and what a result!The facial peel I use once a week or so, because of the cost I was stretching it by using the advanced solutions.  The first thing I noticed was that the dry skin I was having trouble with, which led to combination skin and dry patches on my face improved within a couple of weeks.I developed this odd condition of breaking out along my jaw line and had scars and even acne that just wouldn't go away.. they're finally gone!  Also the breakouts I was having have nearly stopped!  I still do get breakouts, especially right before my period but as soon as it happens I use Biore facial strips to clean out my pores and dab on some Aveeno facial mask, which is also marvelous, and I can control the breakouts.Some might think I use too many products but in reality I rotate them.  Like when I get a zit I dab on some Aveeno facial mask (not on my entire face, just the breakout area) right before the shower and rinse it off at the end.  The gentle mask of soy is cleansing and doesn't clog my pores.  I can't afford facials and facial peels so these are a good alternative.The Neutrogena facial peel MUST be followed up with a good moisturizing lotion.  I personally use Aveeno clear complexion face lotion, this is light and doesn't clog my pores like some of the others.  Also its a good idea to scrub away the flaking skin (usually by the next day) I use Aveeno facial two side scrubs (in round jar).  The face soap doesn't dry my skin out and the scrubbing side is perfect for sloughing off the dried skin.Also try Neutrogena Advanced Solutions - this is more textured then the facial scrub.  White sandy thicker solution that you dab onto your face and use the hand held ""scrubber"" that comes with the kit.  Its not really a scrubber as it doesn't rotate, it vibrates.  Anyway I use this every other day or so, again sparingly.  I don't glop the stuff on my face just a few dots, forehead, cheeks, chin and jaw and anyplace where I might have blackheads and then follow up with the face cream.  Also this doesn't `foam' up like it looks on the commercial, it's more of an exfoliating scrub then a cleanser.  The Facial Peel is thinner and sort of a tan gray color, looks sort of gross and when applying I apply it sparingly in a THIN layer.  You really don't need to put it on heavily.  Your face will tingle, which is normal, massage off with fingertips or sometimes I use my handheld face sponge.  One of those free gifts with an order of something or other.  You can also use the sponge from the advanced solutions in circular motions.  Your face will pink up within thirty minutes after using this so don't panic.  This is normal because it increases circulation to your skin which brings the blood to your cheeks.  Remember to use facial cream while your face is still moist.  Sometimes I forget and then my face feels all dry.I usually use these scrubs after I've taken a shower and my face is moist and pores open.  Also use a hairband or a hair towel to keep hair back, its really annoying trying to wash the face scrub out of your hair.  Follow up with a toner and lotion and you should notice a difference within a couple of weeks.  Other reviews of this product point out that you have to continue to use these products and its true!  But having suffered from acne all my life and been frustrated with the lack of good over the counter products the price is worth purchasing these and using them.  There are ways of stretching the products out like I said above.Also great products are.. and no I don't work for Aveeno, they just have really great products that don't cost a fortune!AveenoClear Complexion Cleansing Mask Clear Complexion Daily Cleansing Pads (this is the one with the scrubbing side and smooth side)Clear Complexion Daily Moisturizer Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser - Absolutely great for daily use or even more then once daily.  In hot weather I use it more often when I feel like a cool rinse.Correcting Treatment, Clear Complexion If you're looking for a good moisturizer for your body, try Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil or the Moisturizing Shower & Bath Oil.  I also use Jergen's ultra healing which you can use on your face also.BioreBlemish Ice CleanserDaily Deep Cleaning Pore Cleansing Cloths - these are sometimes better then using toner on a cotton ball since it's a full cloth.

I contemplated the purchase of the more expensive, highly-rated Braun unit that has the self-cleaning station, but thought better of it because it seemed like more bulk and bother (e.g. purchase and replacement of cleaning solution) than I really needed.  I settled on the 5614 and I am pleased.  I shaved for two weeks before exhausting the battery.  The shaver recharged in about an hour.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the charge does deplete very rapidly once the low-charge light comes on, but according to the specs, I can shave with cord (have not yet tried it) or battery power.  I love the hard case--it protects the shaver head from dents and dings, which were a problem with my old unit.  True, the AC cord does not fit in the case, but that doesn't bother me a bit.  Shave quality is very good.  Trimmer is adequate, but oriented parallel with the long dimension of the shaver, instead of at a 90 degree angle.  Took some getting used to, but I adapted.  In summary, exceptionally high performance:price ratio.  The 5614 was just right for me.",5.0,positive
1734,"B0002MQ9GA:if_you_pay_over_$100_for_an_electric_razor,_you_overpaid...:larry_f._rogers","I use three razors. Last year's model of this Braun, a triple blade rotary from the leading manufacturer of rotary razors and standard double edged disposables from the major manufacturer of razors.OK, now, let's do some math.  I get 10 great shaves from a disposable razor.  I pay, on average, 40c or so for a disposable razor.  That is about a nickel a shave including the shave cream.  At a nickel a shave, it would take 3000 shaves before I would spend $150.  Would take me over 8 years.Now, anyone that says any electric razor shaves better than a double edged high quality blade razor (not even the expensive triple edged ones, just cheap disposables) is dreaming.  The blace does a much better job and much faster.  But, sometimes, they can irritate the skin, but electrics can too.  I can get irritated by both, sooooo, I rotate between them, and find that reduces my skin irritation problem quite well.I bought this Braun (last year's model) after reading the positive reviews here, and later bought a rotary razor.  The basic difference is that the cheap model rotary from that major manufacturer is much quieter, shaves just as well, and cost me about 1/3 the price.The only thing that is better in the Braun is the battery lasts longer.  It is possible also, that in some cases, it gives a slightly closer shave than the rotary, but it also tends to miss spots no matter how many times I go over them.  The Braun also has a problem with my beard when it is longer, like when I have two to three days growth.  The rotary and disposable razor breeze through that three day bush.The cleaning machine/charger that comes with the Braun is a joke.  Yes, it cleans the razor great, but it is way oversized and you need a large space for it in your bathroom.  Even then, say you have that larger space, you can pay between $5.00 and $8.00 each for the cleaning cartridges.  I have found they last about a month before drying out.  Add $60 to your annual cost to just clean your razor.  The rotary cleans fine with a brush and the disposable razors with water.Finally, the switch that turns on the razor is right where you hold the razor and it also locks the blade.  So I am constantly locking the blade position by accident.  Inexcusable design flaw in a razor this price.Don't get me wrong.  This razor shaves fine.  It works best on short beards and works better than cheap razors.  But for $50 you can get a better rotary razor and for $150 you can shave for over 8 years with a disposable twin blade.

The box says it works best to prevent sores from forming, but it worked wonders on my fully-developed canker sore, which was about the size of a dime on the inside of my lower lip, and sliced through the middle so that nerve endings were exposed -- (sorry; I know that's really gross, but seriously, it was excruciating).  After 2 hours I felt a numbing relief; after 6 hours I could tell the canker sore had started to heal over; and a few hours after that, the sore had developed a protective blister-like covering over it, and I could actually eat solid foods again after a week of Starbucks and Jamba Juice (boy was I hungry and cranky this week, esp. since even drinking through straws hurt).  I was diligent about putting the discs consecutively, using 5-6 in 10 hours -- the amazing recovery is well worth it. This product actually heals canker sores.  The last product I used (Orabase by Colgate) actually aggravated the sore because it was essentially like applying nail glue to the raw surface -- incredibly painful and traumatic when it dislodged, which it did after 30 minutes at best.  Note: Cankermelts are not a liquid, but Necco Wafer-like discs, ranging from about 3/8"" to 5/8"" in diameter.  Some may find them a bit awkward to manuveur at first, esp. if your sores are pretty small, but I encourage you to read the directions carefully, and give them a shot.  In addition to actually healing the sores, the active ingredient in these are licorice root, not 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (aka nail glue) like in Orabase.  I'll take a mild licorice taste over toxic glue any day.

At every diaper change we were taking axial temps with one of those standard digital thermometers.  TORTURE!  Took forever and baby screamed her head off the whole time.  Then my sister got this thermometer for us and it is fabulous.What we like:1. When baby is screaming, the light blinks and then goes solid when temp is done, great when you can't hear the beep.2. It truly does take a second unless baby is thrashing about.3. Produces a long beep when you are taking your own temperature, no guesswork about when it's finished which is an improvement over earlier models.What we don't like:1. Preemies have TINY ear holes.  So we have had to wait till our baby's ear was big enough to be able to use this thing.2. The lens covers are a pain to switch out and keep on hand, it would be nice if there were a way to just sanitize the lens after each use.3. We see a discrepancy of almost one degree between the left and right ear which makes us question the accuracy somewhat.  The enclosed brochure explains various causes of this, but that doesn't help when trying to determine what exactly your baby's temperature is.We have done both the axial and ear temp and found that the right ear on our baby corresponds with the digital thermometer's reading on her armpit.  However, the enclosed chart shows the variances between oral, rectal, axial, and ear temperatures which make it somewhat confusing.  So we alternate between the digital and the ear thermometer just to be sure.I personally WOULD recommend this thermometer for older babies and kids, just be sure that you test it out when kids are healthy to figure out your baseline and what is normal.  It takes some investigation to develop your method based on what your needs are, but it is a nice, quick to use product and my family LOVES using it for adult temperature readings.

When the in-office dental bleaching first came around, I wasn't interested in trying it because, at that time, I felt I really didn't need it.  The cost to patients then was close to $500.  Ten years later and no longer practicing dental hygiene, I was ready to try some of the home products that were on the market.  I regularly used, and continue to use, a whitening toothpaste (which basically just removes superficial surface stains from coffee, etc.)  Then I tried the Night Effects ""paint on"" liquid.  Besides being gooey and sort of a pain to use (not to mention looking like Cletus the Slack Jawed Yokel when I went to bed--not an attractive look, ladies) I really didn't see a noticeable whitening.  It's been a couple of years since that attempt, so I was ready to try this product.  But I have to tell you that I found it for about half the going price from a seller on that well-known online auction site (which shall remain nameless, but you know the one.)  You can also go on the Crest website right now (May 2006) and get a coupon for $7.00 off if you want to buy it at a drugstore or supermarket.  I found these strips easy to apply, but someone with large hands or not a lot of dexterity might have a bit of difficulty.  That could be overcome with a little practice.  They do ""stick"" quite well to your teeth, but you can also maneuver them around easily if you need to reposition them during the treatment.  I haven't experienced much sensitivity after using them, and I do back-to-back treatments, which is okay if you don't want to space them out over the course of the day.  You can even skip a day if your teeth are especially sensitive.  I did the upper strips alone first; that way you can lighten the lowers gradually to match the upper better.  Most people aren't as concerned about the whiteness of their lower teeth because the uppers are more visible when smiling.  I don't think you'll get ""blue-white"" teeth like Ed McMahon, but who wants that anyway?  Especially if you're over 50, because let's face facts--there are a lot of other things that give away your age faster than less-than-white teeth!  (Now if they came out with Age Defying Face Strips--the face lift in a box--I'll take one!)  Seriously, the Renewal Whitestrips did lighten up my teeth quite nicely and got rid of the grayish look they had taken on over the years and also some yellowish areas where the enamel had become thinned.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with the product and would use them again when my teeth, inevitably, begin to look dull.  (Oh, and I'm going to turn 60 next year, so I guess I can be an official ""baby boomer"" spokesperson for this product!",4.0,positive

So I had these large dark brown coffee/chocolate stains, and a decision to make about whether to make myself extremely late to work by going home to change.The cafe was next to a supermarket so I decided to go buy a Tide to Go pen and give it a try. I applied it as directed to the stain and immediately the stain lightened noticeably. I was a bit worried because after treatment there were still light tan stains visible, but after blotting the excess liquid and letting the sweater dry while wearing for about half an hour, there was no hint that any mocha had ever touched my sweater.The cleansing agent also gets points for not damaging my silk sweater, despite the fact I was rubbing the product in fairly vigorously (out of desperation...I was going to be late for work!)I'm not sure how it would work on other stains but I will keep one in my purse from now on. On the packaging it does identify which sorts of stains it works best on, and which it will be less effective on. From other reviews this will not work so well on some common food stains, so that's why I'm giving 4 stars and not 5.Another minor concern is the warning about blotting the fluid if fabric will come into contact with direct sunlight.

I prefer to take in liquid protein after a workout, the body absorbs it faster, but in a pinch this would be a great choice.  Beyond that it's a little crispy and a little chewy, there's a physical satisfaction from eating it that makes the experience complete.

She cannot move or open her eyes. It makes her very anxious and we noticed that she hyperventilates when she thinks she is going to ""get dizzy"". We tried to make her breathe slowly and calm down, to no avail. Morgane's doctor told us that breathing slowly and practicing biofeedback were the best non-drug practices against migraines, and we try to avoid giving Morgane medication as she is so young. So I thought of using RESPeRATE as my Dad has high-blood pressure and I knew it worked on the breathing pattern.Morgane immediately understood how to use the device, it was so easy and even fun for her. It relaxes her and gives her the strength to know she can do something about her migraines. Her breathing pattern has reduced considerably and so far, she has not had another migraine attack for about 6 months.

After 3 days they did get back to me, recommending Amazon as a purchase source but ignoring my request for operations information. I sent a second email but it was completely ignored. Maybe this should have been a warning. I decided to go ahead and order one anyway. The purchasing process was quick and easy and delivery form Amazon's agent was about 5 days, more than acceptable. The unit comes well packaged with easy to follow instructions. Actual programming is simple and very straight forward. The problems started after successfully programming my dad's satellite receiver.

I tried all of the codes listed for the manufacturer of that receiver, none of them made any difference. Another email to Hy-Tek, and another 3 day wait, produced the response "" it doesn't work with all devices and I guess it just won't work with your receiver, you'll have to send it back to the supplier. We will make note of this and maybe we can add this receiver in a future update. "" No help at all and no concern or consideration expressed on the part of the manufacturer. If they had bothered to respond to my original inquiry in the first place, I would never have purchased this substandard piece of equipment and wouldn't have been out the freight charges.

Showers feel pretty good on the regular setting, and the massage setting is decent too.The showerhead was easy to install and everything was included except for teflon pipe tape which we found necessary to prevent leaks when we screwed this into the main plumbing.When the head is resting in the cradle, it arches up a few inches, which makes it nice for tall people to be under. The hose is also plenty long enough to reach to the other end of the tub.The problem we had is that the showerhead does not fit snugly into the cradle, unless we unnaturally force it. Just setting the showerhead in the cradle results in the showerhead moving when the water is turned on, mostly because the hose still has curl in it. He solved this problem with 2 hair clips to hold the hose still.One word of caution -- if you unscrew the swivel piece, be careful not to lose the rubber ring, because it falls out easily. Without it, the swivel leaks badly.All things considered, I would buy this product again, and would suggest it as long as it is going to be used solely as a hand-held showerhead or solely as a cradled showerhead.

I started using the McKenzie Method extension exercises, and this offered the most relief.  Fortunately, I finally discovered the Lumbar Extender in an internet ad.  I noticed that it placed the spine in a similar position as the McKenzie exercises.  So, I decided to order the Lumbar Extender to determine if it would provide better relief than all the other methods I was using.  The first two weeks that I used the Lumbar Extender, I had some minor discomfort.  Now after five weeks using the Lumbar Extender, I can honestly say that my back has not felt better in two years.  This device does all that it says it will do.  I actually enjoy lying on it for two seven-minute sessions each day-one session in the morning and one session at night.  When I first used the device, I heard snapping noises in my lower back, probably the spinal facets being repositioned, and then I would experience immediate relief.

After filling, carefully push down on the sides and move your hands towards the fill hole, until all of the air is gone. Remove the fill tube, while watching the water level, keeping it just below the pillow's surface and install the cap.  This will prevent air pockets and water sloshing, while you lay your head on it.  It may take two or three tries to get the right feel you're looking for, but it's well worth it.

I had been using another kit that uses benzoyl peroxide as its main acne-fighting ingredient, but it really dried my skin out and the bleaching action of the peroxide ruined countless towels and T-shirt necklines.So when a friend recommended Nature's Gate Organics Acne Kit, I thought I'd give it a try.  After that first kit, I've never even considered using anything else.  I find the salicylic acid based formula gentler on my skin but still very effective at clearing up breakouts and preventing new ones.  I've used salicylic acid products in the past without the greatest results, but however Nature's Gate Organics acne product is formulated, IT WORKS.  (According to their packaging, it's the combination with the Oligopeptide-10 that makes the salicylic acid more effective.)  It's really important to stick to the complete regimen, though.  When I first started using the kit, I used the three products haphazardly, using the cleanser one day but not the toner and lotion, etc.  I could tell the difference, though, when I followed the package directions and used all three.  The cleanser, toner and lotion each have their function and I'm really happy with how my skin feels and looks when I use the whole system.  I've gotten a lot of compliments on how good my skin looks, too, since I started using Nature's Gate Organics.This is also the first formula I've found that didn't dry out my skin.  I think most acne products are formulated for teens with really oily skin.  For those of us past puberty (I'm 30+) but still dealing with adult acne, we need products that are effective but gentle. And the fact that it contains natural/organic ingredients is an added bonus.  All of those botanicals makes it smell great, too! For me, Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment is perfect.  I don't write a lot of reviews, but I felt compelled when I saw it posted here because I really believe in this product.

I especially felt and saw visable result around my neck and throat area(where I am really starting to get that over 50 look).It has a nice, very light scent, and here's the best part... The price here at Amazon is about 1/2 of what I paid when I purchased it along with my groceries at the market(and it was even on sale at the store), so at around twelve dollars here right now, it's a real bargain.There are 7 benefits listed on the box, some I mentioned above, others include evening skin tone, minimizes the appearance of pores and reduces the appearance of blotches and age spots. Give this one a try for any of these aging signs.Don't expect a miracle. The wrinkles will not vanish, but a nice improvement in the look and feel of your skin, a healthy glow that leaves you feeling just a little better about yourself(and a a great price).The formula includes a fast absorbing skin strengthener called VitaNiacin(Vit B3, Vit E and Pro-Vit B5),wheat protein and hydrators.I like it and recommend it.....Laurie",5.0,positive

I would have designed a screw-type plug that was replacable, but they didn't think of that. Anyway, once you punch the quarter-size disc out it's out forever.If you choose to use the continuous drainage feature, you will need to pick up a hose with an inner diameter of 15mm (.59"" or just over half an inch.) I went to the local DIY center and found some clear tubing that has worked well.The unit can operate down to 2-degrees C (36-degrees F), which will be great for continuous operation in the garage to keep the tools from rusting.Has three fan settings: med, high and quiet. ""Quiet"" really is quiet, and could probably work just fine in a bedroom. Though, it does warm the room it's in. How much it warms it depends on the humidity setting.Four settings: The humidty level (humidstat) can be set to ""continuous dehumidification"" (which is the default setting), 50%, 60% and 70%. The fan will continue to run but the dehumidification processor will turn off when it reaches the selected humidity level. Cool. I mean, that's when the fan will just blow room-temp air.A full drainage tank will stop the unit and illuminate a ""tank full"" indicator light.The unit is not that heavy -- maybe for some, but not nearly as heavy as some people make it sound. It's 30.8 pounds.According to the instructions: You will need at least 21 cm (about 8 inches) of clearance in front, behind and side to side. Air blows out of the top of the unit, so you'll need to make sure it's clear as well.There are movable louvers on the top to direct the air straight up, 45-degrees or almost straight ahead.Power consumption: CFM-25E is 220W // CFM-40E is 330WI highly recommend this model dehumidifier",5.0,positive

People who are irritated by benzoyle peroxide probably won't have the same kind of experience I do.  BP creams have always helped, but were not as effective as this mask, which really gets down in the pores.I use it heavily.  I apply it either before I brush my teeth or before I get in the shower.

The dryness others warn of has never been an issue for me.  it makes my skin feel like normal healthy skin.Working outside in the heat or cleaning in a dusty, dirty environment used to cause my skin to break out.

I guess it blocks the irritants or stops the sebaceous glands from making my pores either block or become a haven for bacteria.I do not have serious acne all over my body...just a very trouble prone face for most of my adult life.

The company's website did not have as many detailed specs as I wanted to see before buying the product, so I called customer service. To receive 10,000 lux, you have to sit at least as close as 15 inches.  The manual says with the ionizer on, you can sit as far as 20 inches (I'm not sure I believe that - I think it's just recommended for a ""treatment session"", not for the 10,000 lux). Also, the lights should be good for about 3 years (there are 4 in the lamp), and it's currently $60 to replace all 4.  As for the ionizer, I wasn't looking for anything like this feature, and I was skeptical about it at first.  However, I have since learned that it is a great plus to the light itself; it's like having fresh air blowing at you. With the ionizer and the lamp on, I almost feel like I'm sitting outside on a sunny day.

My house in SoCal had a water purification system (softened water); turns out my apartment building chlorinates the water before distributing it throughout the building. After just ONE shower, my skin was showing signs of calming down.  I couldn't even catch a whiff of chlorine.  The bumpiness went down, and all I have to do is wait for the scarring to go away to return my skin to its former glory.

I will occasionally catch a woman checking me out, but it is a rare occurrence unless I make the first move and woo her with my charm.This morning at 7am I put the recommended amount of M11 behind each ear and went up to my wife to kiss her goodbye (no effect). At about 8am, while getting my coffee, I caught a fairly attractive middle age woman checking me out from about ten feet away. What was really amazing is she was staring at me with the same awestruck look as I sometimes have when I see a very beautiful woman. As the day progressed, many women passed me by without even noticing me. However, at about 11AM I caught another middle age woman checking me out with that awestruck look; this time she was about five feet away. Now I was starting to think that there may actually be something to this M11.Lastly I visited an account at about 1PM and as soon as I walked in there was a drop dead gorgeous woman (about 22 years old) that couldn't take her eyes off of me (she had that same awestruck look). This time she was about six feet away. While I was waiting for my client to come to the lobby I introduced myself and she warmed right up to me. I didn't take it any further as I was with some business associates and I am married. A little later I turned to catch her staring at me again and she quickly turned her head apparently hoping I didn't catch her.After 3 PM (about eight hours after applying the M11) I didn't seem to be affecting anyone else. Therefore, I concluded that the pheromone wears off in about eight hours.Apparently, this stuff doesn't work on every woman. However, I have never been checked out so intensely by three women in one day (and never by a drop dead gorgeous 22 year old). My theory is that a small minority of woman are genetically predisposed to be effected by pheromones. So, while it won't work on every woman it will work on about one in five (or maybe one in ten). Unfortunately, my wife doesn't fall into this group.  However, it did wonders for my self esteem and I will use it again.By the way the product is totally odorless when used in the recommended amounts.

I take every opportunity to tell parents about using a hand baby food mill.  The $10 I paid for my baby food mill was definitely one of the best investments I ever made! I purchased it for my first of six children, and just LOVED it! I found that it was much, much more convenient than a blender, for several reasons. A blender is fine for preparing large batches of baby food to freeze, but not a bit practical for making a single serving for your baby. The blender is much more difficult to clean, not very practical to take to the table, and it is difficult to get all of the food out of the bottom of it.  The noise of it doesn't make it especially handy for table use, either.  The hand grinder is perfectly quiet, makes use of every bit of food that you put into it, and can be taken and used anywhere!  It is very handy for feeding the baby out of, directly, and the parts are easy to hand wash or can be thrown in the dishwasher.  Also, it is very easy to feed the baby some of the same foods that you have prepared for your whole family. The food does not come out pureed, like with a blender, but I found that my babies preferred to have a little texture. It can be used on almost anything except for hard, dry foods, like chips, or taco shells.  Many harder foods, like fresh apples, should be diced first.  Some foods come out better with the addition of a little water or other liquid. My grinder is in retirement now, after 14 years of use, but it is still in good working order.  I am saving it for the day when I will have grandchildren to use it for!  I just can't say enough good about it, and hope that many parents will try it.

Someone in a salon used this on me and I was stunned at the silky results.

A friend knew how much I adored this, but didn't want to drop the cash, and got it for me as a gift.This has now become an indispensible part of my hair regimen.  I usually blow dry my mid-back length hair with a dryer, since that's pretty fast, but I can be kind of careless about it because I follow up with this iron.  I section my hair and get it super smooth and shiny with this iron.  I love the small plate size because I can roll the hair around the edge of the iron and get it to curl under.This keeps my hair going for days.  I can just freshen it up with the iron, no need to dry my hair out by washing and blow drying every single day.  If I come in contact with a little rain and get frizzy, I just touch up with the iron.  I love this product!There is no heat-up required with this.  I plug it in and it is ready to go in a matter of seconds.  The variable heat settings are great.

It didn't help any that the mounting holes were extremely hard to locate once the plate was mounted - it's hard to see thru that white plastic shell.

The placement of the strap doesn't allow the pad to conform to the body, but only to press against it where the strap runs through - just the center, not the rest of the pad.I realize there are probably now safety standards for heating pads that preclude them from getting too warm, but hopefully they are not so stringent as to not allow any electric heating device from getting warm enough to penetrate sore muscles properly.  For the time being I'll keep wearing Thermacare(TM)  back wraps (which are expensive - could have bought two heating pads by now) but do last 8 hours at a time and provide intense enough heat.

Aside from the hassle of constantly repositioning the cushion, or picking it off the floor (which may be difficult for someone with back pain), this lumbar support is excellent. Accompanied by a coccyx cushion, this cushion is wonderful for my back. I do recommend it to anyone in need of lumbar support, regardless of the cushion's inability to remain in one place.This is a great product, but it is poorly designed.

2439,"B000FKGOZA:too_expensive_form_of_aspirin:james_koenig_""konedog4""","Bayer is a name-brand aspirin.  Any brand-name drug will cost at least double of that of the equivalent generic aspirin.  I give this a one-star rating not because it is a poor product, rather, because it is so expensive. The dosage is 81 mg, taken to thin the blood to prevent heart attacks and strokes (generally taken by older individuals who perhaps have arteriosclerosis, have had a heart attack or stroke).  Aspirin is a wonder-drug, the very first analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to hit the market over 100 years ago. It is for mild to moderate pain and treats many different conditions such as arthritis, bone inflammation, joint pain, and even reduces fever. Aspirin causes blood platelets to not adhere to each other, thus it ""thins"" the blood and prevents blood clots from forming. Aspirin is thus used in emergency treatment of heart attacks and strokes. Some folks take a ""baby"" aspirin (81-160 mgs) each day to prevent blood clots from forming. Aspirin is actually acetyl-salicylic acid. Manufacturers alter the structure of aspirin slightly to grant it different properties in terms of its digestion, to make digestion easier. Some buffer it with antacids while others coat the tablet with a coating that prevents its digestion in the stomach (like Ecotrin). Regular aspirin, without any buffering or coatings is tolerated by most people, but some cannot take it without severe stomach upset. For these folks, the buffered form is a god-send. Unfortunately, Aspirin fell out of favor in the 60's and 70's when Reye's Syndrome developed in some children (under the age of 16) who took aspirin while they had the flu and/or chickenpox. About 30% of the children affected died and many more had permanent brain damage. Because of Reye's Syndrome, alternate analgesics were placed on the market, the premier being Tylenol. There is no reason to fear using aspirin if you are an adult, as Reye's Syndrome only occurred in children under 16 years of age. The usual dose of aspirin is 350 mg, with the ""extra-strength form at 500 mg. Most adults will easily tolerate a dose of 650 mg (2 tablets) every 4 hours with a maximum daily dose of 5,200 mg. (Some with rheumatoid arthritis take up to 7200 mg/day with a doctor's supervision). There is no additional benefit to taking more than 1,000 mg every 4 hours. Increasing the dose beyond this point will only increase the toxicity of aspirin. Aspirin should be avoided in people taking blood-thinning medications, those with stomach ulcers, and used with caution in insulin-dependent diabetics. Allergies can develop to aspirin as well. Never mix aspirin with any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, such as Ibuprofen, as there is no pain benefit and the gastric upset chance is greatly increased. Don't mix aspirin with alcohol either, as it is hard on the stomach. Used properly, aspirin is a terrific medication. I prefer to buy my aspirin in a generic form. One pays more for aspirin if it is produced by a name-brand manufacturer. However, the big-manufacturers also package aspirin in some of the buffered forms that some people tolerate better.

2473,B000GAO6Z4:don't_use_around_the_eyes!:d._watson,"Overall, this isn't a bad sunscreen. It contains avobenzone, which is recommended by dermatologists for its broad-spectrum protection.  The scent is light and not too objectionable.  It's a little thicker than some sunscreens, which makes it more difficult to spread, but it also ensures more complete coverage.  One minor drawback is that it's greasy and sticky, as are most sunscreens.  But the worst problem is migration into the eyes (Coppertone products seem to be among the worst with this).  Since it's advertised as waterproof and ""non-stinging"" and is specifically targeted for use on young children, you'd think it would be safe to use close to the eyes, but such is not the case.  My young daughter had a small amount of water splash her face, and she instantly felt the sunscreen stinging her eye.  This was about an hour after application, and the amount of water that hit her eye was only a few drops.  The debilitating discomfort persisted for the entire day and couldn't be relieved by rinsing her eye with saline.  (Water Babies isn't waterproof on the eyelids, but apparently it sticks pretty well to the eye itself!)So the bottom line is that this sunscreen is acceptable for use on the body, but avoid using it anywhere near the eyes",2.0,negative

So I prefer it to the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash for that reason.It also takes just a tiny dab in the palm of one hand to lather up your face very well, so one tube lasts quite a while, and the bottom dispensing tube is very convenient.HOWEVER, the wide and flat at the bottom design means that when you can no longer squeeze anything out there's still quite a bit left in there.

2595,233231,"Now that I'm writing this review, it seems silly that I'm so happy over such a small thing as a toothbrush.  But I am.  I bought this item not long after I had my first (and hopefully only) root canal and crown four years ago, something which I never again want to experience in my life (as someone else described, it was painful and expensive).  Growing up, I didn't take care of my teeth like I should've, so I'm accustomed to always being told there's either a cavity, or the start of one, and having to have more work done.  After the root canal, my mom recommended a brush that had at least a certain number of pulsations/oscillations, because that's what she'd been recommended by her dentist to combat her receding gums.  This specific item met those requirements, and it was affordable.  When I first started using it, my gums were very sensitive to it, but that quickly wore off, so it seems to me that it strengthens the gums.  It is also MUCH easier to get behind the front teeth.  Subsequent dentist vists by my mom have shown that her gums have improved dramatically after using a high-quality electric toothbrush such as this one (I honestly don't remember if she has this exact model, but ours are similar), and I've not needed any work done at the dentist beyond regular cleanings since I purchased it.As far as cleaning the unit to keep it from ""gunking"" up, I'm the only person who uses this item, so any extra toothbrush heads are still in the package they came in, not dripping into the storage container; so I don't know how to combat that.  But I just take the toothbrush head off the thing and rinse it, then rinse the hand-held part, and set them back on the unplugged charger/base (I only plug it in when the battery runs low) and things stay clean with no problem",5.0,positive

I read the first review that stated their disatisfaction b/c the readings were ""high"".  I would recommend calibrating the unit yourself and if it is off, return it for another or a refund.  For the last week I've tested several monitors in the local stores (Omron, ReliOn, LifeSource) and I felt that all of them reported low BP readings.  I even ordered one that was very eratic in its readings but was always 10 to 12 points lower than the readings taken w/a stethiscope (sometimes I used the BP machine at Wal-Mart, which seemed to be consistent).  I returned it for a refund.I work at a hospital, and a co-worker used the new UA-787EJ this morning, found that his blood pressure was very high, went down to ER and indeed it was extremely high.  If you have doubts about the accuracy, I suggest purchasing the manual steth., gauge and cuff to do your own calibartion.

2621,B0009MFUN6:norelco_quality_going_downhill:patrick_d.,"The Good9170XLCC gives an excellent shave in about 5 minutes.  It'll take about 2 weeks of daily use for your beard to adjust to the razor heads, but after that it's as close and clean as any blade shave.The Bad:1. It's cheaply made.  Norelco has outsourced manufacturing & it shows.  The frame holding the razor heads is plastic; every other Norelco I've owned (over 30 years) has been metal.  The frame is supported by these weird plastic-bubble ""shock absorbers"" that will probably go in a year or two.  The shaver has a junky, cheap feel to it.  I have always gotten 5-6 years of use out of my past Norelcos; this one feels like it'll last about two years.2. Cleaning tank is a marketing gimmick to sell $[...]/bottle cleaning solution.  Way overkill.  It does work OK, but the shaver gets just as clean if you rinse it under hot tap water (which you will have to do anyway because the cleaning solution leaves the razor heads coated with a slimy residue).  You can pretty much throw it out after the free bottle of solution is used up.3. I'm already on my second unit.  The chip that controls the battery level indicator, recharging, etc. is flakey.  The first one I had never could accurately display battery level even after 3 complete charge-discharge-recharge cycles.  It'd show 15-20 minutes remaining, then just die in the middle of the shave; battery tapped out.  Also, it would sometimes illuminate for no reason at all; had to turn on-off to clear it.  If it happened during the night, the battery would be fully discharged by morning.  So I returned it to Amazon.com (thx Amazon for great customer service!!!).The second one that they sent to me recharges continuously when you use it with the cleaning tank -- it's not supposed to charge during the 55-minute cleaning cycle, but mine does.  That means that you have to catch it about 5 minutes into the cycle, after it's done it's dunking in the tank, or it'll recharge completely after every shave (which the instructions tell you not to do because it shortens battery life).  More reason to toss the cleaning unit.  Ridiculous on a shaver this expensive that they'd ship junk to their customers before fixing these problems.4. The travel case is worthless for protecting the shaver on the road.  It's nothing but a zippered nylon sack.  You'll have to put the shaver into something else if you pack it in checked luggage or it'll be a pile of parts when you unpack.5. They don't include a stand so when you're done shaving you lay it on the bathroom countertop.  I'm using the one from my old Norelco, but if you don't have one, storage between shaves is just setting it down somewhere.Sad to see a fine old company like Norelco cheapening it's flagship product like this.

My hair has grown back finer, but I still had hairy legs most of the time because waxing never removed all of the hair before my skin gave out, or the hair would grow back at different rates. So I decided to give an epilator a try.  I had bought one back in the 80's and it was a medieval torture device.  This new Epilady is great.  It is far less painful than waxing.  I just feel a slight prick rather than a giant skin pull. It is no worse than plucking an eyebrow hair.  The charge lasts a long time.  I recently took it on a ten-day trip and it never ran out.  Next time I won't even take the cord. And the unit isn't very heavy, so it packs well.  I am using it about once a week, and I actually enjoy the process somewhat.  You do have to be careful to stretch the skin taut in the underarm area.  I nicked myself one day on the soft skin there, but no problems on the legs. I also have to make a few passes at some hairs to get them to stand up and catch, but it hasn't been a huge problem.  I also like how I can do quick touch-ups on my way out the door if necessary.

I was pretty happy with the results for spending $15 and only taking 2 hours. I did have some bad gum pain the following day however. It was only bad that one day, but the discomfort didn't go away completely for probably 3 whole days.

Learn each person's base temp before the fever begins.IMPORTANT - if the patient has a hot forehead due to sunburn and you suspect a fever developing, use another non-forehead means to double check.  We gave our child fever-reducing medicine only to realize the ""sunstroke fever"" turned out to be heat from sunburn on the skin itself.  Apply some aloe vera, wait, and then check when the skin has had a chance to recover a bit.  Double check with alternate thermometer.Of course, I also find that the ""lip test"" is great too.  An old pro taught it to me.  If you touch your lips to your child's forehead, you can easily tell if the heat you felt with your hand is fever or just a warm body.

As she used it, the problem became more and more frequent.  Now, the unit will not work unless it is at one point and at a certain angle (which I guess allows electricity to go to the unit).  I tried taping it to that location but the cord also has to stay at that certain angle which is impossible to maintain when using the iron.  This is not very good for such an expensive item which gets alot of twisting and turning use and should have the highest materials and workmanship to prevent electrical.  My wife admits that like anyone the unit has been dropped, but that should not cause an electrical cord problem.  Dropping the iron risks breaking the two flat iron ceramic plates, which are still perfectly intact.  The problem is that because of the cord, and the way a flat iron is used, there is alot of cord twisting.  For what is advertised as a ""professional"" device and at a cost which only a professional would normally purchase, we cannot believe that this could be used in a ""professional"" environment.  My wife only uses it six or seven times a week, not six or seven times a day like in a salon.  We highly recommend that you STAY AWAY from this product.",1.0,negative

These sponges pick upi dirt you didn't even know was there.  Let me tell you some of the ways I have put them to use:1.  Used it on the kitchen walls/ceiling to remove dirt/grease film - looks like new.  (Do not recommend using on flat finish or cheaper paints though without checking an area first).2.  Used it to quickly remove soap scum from the shower/tub without having to use chemicals.  3.  Used it to remove car wax from the black plastic portions of my car (don't you hate it when you get wax on there and you can't get it off?)4.  Used it on my kitchen counter to remove a wine stain.5.  Used it to get the gumminess off things I had purchased that had those annoying gummy labels on them.And I am still finding uses for these.  They recommend not using them on wood and I agree.  I tested it and it will remove the finish.  However if you are planning to refinish your natural wood (not painted) kitchen cabinets with something like Rejuvenate Cabinet Restorer (also a great product) then I recommend cleaning them with a Magic Eraser first to improve adherence (worked for me, but test it first on the inside of a cabinet door to make sure you will see good results too).Note - this is not like your typical sponge and does not replace the typical sponge... but instead can remove dirt where the traditional psonge can't.  Magic Erasers disintigrate as you use them so they will not last as long as a traditional sponge.  BJ's club used to sell their own brand of Magic Eraser (for less $), but I have not seen them there for awhile.",5.0,positive

With the first use of this product, I felt as if I had come out of the dark ages of shaving. My most hated daily routine has become a joy! I migrated from blades to foil shaving 5 years ago, and thought that was a remarkable achievement, in addition to conserving blood and possibly saving my life. Although the last Consumer Reports test showed that there was virtually no difference between foil and rotary shaving, I got the bug when a local store put all their rotary shavers on sale. They assured me that I could return any shaver for any reason, so I had nothing to lose. After reviewing online comments, and wanting a cord/cordless, I narrowed my search down to the Norelco 7885XL and the Remington R-960, which was quite a bit less expensive than the Norelco. I brought them home, waited for 2 days growth of beard, and performed a ""face-off."" (Pardon the pun) I shaved one side of my face with the Noreleo and the other with the Remington. I felt my face and noticed no big difference. But later, I noticed that the Norelco side felt slightly irritated. I was warned that there might be a transition period from foil to rotary, so this didn't concern me. But, I never did get an irritated on the Remington side. The next day I felt my face and could clearly tell that the growth on the Remington side was less than the Norelco side. My conclusion was that I got a closer shave with no irritation with the Remington--and for far less money! My lifelong belief that price does not necessarily equal excellence in a product was again reinforced. After the first few days I went back and got another R-960 for travel, and I have been happily shaving for the first time in my life because of this great shaver. The R-960 appears to me to be better built, certainly more stylish, and comes with a sturdy, high quality case. It has a good grip and requires absolutely no pressure on  my face in order to get a close shave. And no more stray hairs that my girlfriend usually discovers after it's too late to remove them.

2806,192562,"This review is about the Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said ""this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth"" or some such statement like that. Well, I haven't lost one yet. The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing. Since I've always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I'm using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth; it's kind of hard to deny it works. My dentist has confirmed this on direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.

It's a MUST for weight loss.  I weighed 176 the day I got it, I'm at 157 right now.As for the water percentage, it's worthless- as long as you're over 50% (for a male), your fine.  It's related to the body fat %.  The body fat % fluctuates too much to be that great.  It's a good rough estimate- but I go from 16-19% depending on when I weigh myself.  I find that I'm 16% when I follow the recommended advice (don't eat for 2 hours and then weight yourself), but that's definitely too low in my opinion.  I still got a small beer belly.  19% seems more accurate and I get that after I eat.  But the body fat percentage has definitely gone down since I lost weight, so like I said -it's a good estimate, but don't worry about 3% fluctuations.I think the key with this scale is to note your lowest weight (in the morning when you get up, just do the weigh only option).  That way if that weight goes down, you know you lost weight!

Right in the box from Remington is a red warning tag that says exactly that. The first few shaves were rough ... my skin felt and looked raw in a few patches. Not a good experience and frankly it's what I suspect most of the negative reviews here are based on. However, having made this transition in the past I was intent on completing the adjustment. Well, it's been two weeks and shaves are fine. Better than fine, the shaves are very close leaving a wonderfully smooth face. The irritation is almost completely gone and really only appears when I'm too vigorous on parts of my neck with tender skin. I consider this more my fault than the shaver's. Electric shaving isn't for everyone. Furthermore, there are shavers which will treat skin more tenderly but not produce as close a shave.

Baskets of used blades and mountains of lather have been my constant companions until recently at which point I dared to explore mans' progression as a species.  Can you believe? Technology, innovation, divine inspiration, dare to achieve. There is hope yet for our survival as I base my conclusion solely on the benefits of being able to finally enjoy without hassel or fear ""The Joy Of Shaving"".

It was also a pain in the butt having to spread the shaving cream, and then get rid of it every day.Now I am using the Spectra and I'm very happy with it.The instructions tell you to give up to 3 weeks for your face to get used to the new shaving system.But in my opinion, it is just a way for them to make you LEARN first how to use the machine. I did not notice any differences in the skin or shave after the ""getting used to"" period compared to the first day I used the Norelco.But I do not mean that there is no difference in the skin.You feel the skin a lot better and softer after the fist shave with this system vs. the razor.I am still learning how to get the best shave with it.I have shaved my face to the point that I got a CLOSER shave than the razor a few times. And other times I get a just OK shave, but not as close as before.I think it depends on how the hair reacts to the machine any given day.Sometimes I spend more time to get the same results as other days. But no more than 5 minutes.I always used it in normal mode. This way it is supposed to be the fastest.My tip to you would be this:The instructions tell you to shave with your face clean.But if you shave right after taking your daily shower, is like your face gets humid and less slippery for the Norelco. I had better results with my face really dry. So I clean my face the night before and shave when I wake up, before taking my shower. This way I have my face clean and really dry.Sometimes you have to make more than a gentle pressure with the heads on your face to catch and cut the hair closer.I got some irritation in my lower part of the neck a few times... it is a little difficult to catch the hairs in that area.. may be because the skin is softer in there.The battery last a lot.It is a very practical machine, and comes with a pouch so I can shave the mornings I wake up at my girlfriend's home.No more blood for me. But take care with your lip. Once i catch it a little with the spectra and got a bad feeling in it for a few days.I think that with some more time, I will perfect the technique and always get the shave I want with the Spectra 8825XL.I recommend this machine to anyone.

It seemed to be too much hassle.  In fact, it's really simple.  I use it daily with my third child and wish I'd experimented with it a few years ago.  Our pediatrician encourages us to give our child what we eat, not to depend on Gerber or Beech Nut too much.  The problem is that it's difficult to mash (with a spoon or fork) foods like banana, avocado, potato, small curd cottage cheese and other soft foods to the consistency that my child will eat (super smooth).  This food grinder does that for you.  It is really easy to clean and simple to tote around.  I'll even mill several foods during one sitting, cleaning it between food types - it's that easy to take apart, clean and reassemble.In response to other reviews on this site, you can put cooked chicken into it, or crisp apple, but these won't become as smooth as yogurt.  For that, you'd have to add water to the chicken, possibly add some other blending agent like potato, and use an electric blender.  For apple or carrots, you'd need to cook it before you could put it into the mill and it would become smooth (like applesauce).  Milling foods like corn and peas will probably result in some residual solid bits (the skin of the pea or kernel).  To completely rid the food of that, you'd have to use a seive; even an electric blender would yield some solid bits.This product is probably most useful for children between the ages of 6 months and 1 year",4.0,positive

An experiment that I tried that you can duplicate (if you have any interest): eat a ""problem"" food that usually leaves bits stuck between your teeth. For me, this means blueberries (the skins) or tuna.  Brush with your manual brush. Then rinse and spit several times, until no more debris is coming out.  Now floss throughly and then rinse and spit several times again. How much more debris do you get now?  This is what your toothbrush did not get. Now try it again with the Oral B.   With the Oral B brush, my mouth FEELS much cleaner, and I end up with much less food left for the floss to get.   I chose the 7550 because I wanted the Oral B ""3D Brushing Action"" mechanism at the lowest price, and when I looked at the various models for sale, it seemed that the major difference between them (that was not just gimmicks) was the number and types of brush heads that were included with each model. I figured that since these were expendables, I would be buying more of them over the years anyway.  In the end, the 7550 with the four brush heads that are included and 6 refills that I bought at the same time cost less than some of the fancier models with fewer heads.

That wax is pernicious... it gets on everything... so be warned.I've gotten my eyebrows waxed at a strip mall salon before a few times. The last session was with someone I've never had do it before - and the results showed she likely hadn't been doing it that long. At $10 a pop plus tip, I finally realized I should be doing this myself - no more shelling out the money and having a language barrier on how I want it done, etc.It does take a while for the wax to sufficiently warm up - about 30 minutes. The instructions are lackluster - so they lose a star just for that. I would say 99% of the instructions are legal jargon to keep them from being sued... like don't  use this on your privates, etc. Pulllease! No insider tips - they assume you've graduated from beauty school and don't bother to tell you much at all. Thanks to wikipedia, I learned a lot about waxing and felt better about using this gizmo.I have successfully waxed my armpits - this took 3 separate sessions. I would have never had that done in a salon. I'm one of those unfortunate women that have bumpy armpit skin... so the hairs go in every direction and shaving means I get cut every single time I shave.One day, when I can afford it, I will get laser hair removal, but in the mean time, it is pretty easy to do waxing at home for the armpits, eyebrows and sideburns.  I've struggled with the legs.. so much surface area... and you're only supposed to apply the wax once to the skin per session, so I like my skin to have a few days off before attempting again, otherwise the skin peels.Other kits I looked at didn't look as easy to operate, which is why I chose this warmer. While it's a bit of a scam that all their wax cans fit only in this warmer, no other brand seems to have a structured fit. So far, I am pleased with the results- the wax really grabs the hair and when yanking a bunch at the same time, there is hardly any discomfort... and nothing like the pain and monotony of plucking each hair with tweezers",4.0,positive

3113,B0002TLDRI:fantastic_for_its_purpose:jack_jonez,"I've tried many pheromones and consider myself something of an ""expert"". I'm not a biochemist, so take this for what it's worth: Androstenone is a pheromone which can attract attention from women, but only some women and only when they're ovulating. So if you want a one-night stand hookup, get something with a lot of androstenone (like Pherone D-17X, which I'm also reviewing). The problem with androstenone is that it can also quickly be intimidating or turn women off if they're not ready for it. So a better choice is a product like M-11 which has other pheromones that ""modulate"" the androstenone (and doesn't have too much androstenone). This one can turn women on but doesn't scare them off. On the other hand, if you're at all an intimidating kind of guy, what you really need is my favorite one, V-5, which has NO androstenone at all. V-5 is my every-day phero, and I use M-11 for going out to clubs. It works for me!By the way, if you can smell it that means your using too much. Some other companies make ""odor free"" pheromones.

B) I would like just a bit larger shaving area on the Cleancut shaver. At just a hair over an inch wide (maybe 1-1/8"") it took quite a bit of time to cover all the necessary areas. While the size is surely designed for nooks and crannies, I still think a little larger surface area would have worked just as well and also cut down on the shaving time.That said, this product is well worth the money, and I highly recommend it to anyone. It's great being able to get such a close shave without messy shave creams, gels, or lotions...or painful waxing",4.0,positive

The Norelco was my first electric shaver, so I had nothing to compare it to, but I was never satisfied with the shave I got from it.  Because of this, I carefully compared brands and models trying to choose the best replacement without letting the price sway my decision.  I chose this shaver mostly because of the reputation of the Remington brand.  I have used this shaver for over a month now and am still amazed at how close a shave it gives (I use it dry.)  I never thought an electric shaver could give a shave so close to a razor.  I was also surprised at how long the charge lasts.  I haven't tested the limits yet, but I have gotten at least 3 days use without re-charging, which I never came close to with the Norelco (even when it was new.)The cleaning feature is an added bonus.  Just pop it on the charger, push the ""clean"" button and walk away - it's that easy!  It stops automatically when it's finished.  As for how loud it is during the cleaning process-- it does start out loud, but it goes through several different cycles and the loud ones don't last very long.  The noise doesn't bother me anyway because I push the clean button and leave the room.

After considerable research, I chose the Air-O-Swiss. So far (two months) it seems well worth its high price. It is by far the easiest to live with of any console or tabletop humidifier I've owned.It has performed beautifully in my modest 15' X 15' bedroom. No problems with over or under humidification. No white dust (so far, at least). No more morning sore throat, dried out nasal passages or hacking cough, either.Further, it's blessedly quiet. Admittedly, my others have not been ultrasonic devices, so I can't compare with other machines using the same technology, but compared to standard evaporative units this is a silent delight. The tank is large enough that it needs to be filled only once or twice a day (except during extremely cold weather). Filling it presents no more difficulty than any other unit I've owned.I like the easy to use, well designed automatic mode, as well as the option of warm or cool mist. I use warm while I'm sleeping, cool to reduce operating costs when I'm not in the room. (It's on 24/7 because I'm home all day.)On the downside, it is expensive to buy and maintain (the filter cartridge refills and sticks are overpriced, but they do work well). High maintenance cost is the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars.In addition, it does occasionally slightly moisten the rug nearby, although not consistently and never enough to soak through (the instructions warn against using it on the floor, so I knew I was doing so at my own risk). The tank removal and replacement process inevitably results in a few drops dripping on the floor, too.

An experiment that I tried that you can duplicate (if you have any interest): eat a ""problem"" food that usually leaves bits stuck between your teeth. For me, this means blueberries (the skins) or tuna.  Brush with your manual brush. Then rinse and spit several times, until no more debris is coming out.  Now floss throughly and then rinse and spit several times again. How much more debris do you get now?  This is what your toothbrush did not get. Now try it again with the Oral B.   With the Oral B brush, my mouth FEELS much cleaner, and I end up with much less food left for the floss to get.   I chose the 7550 because I wanted the Oral B ""3D Brushing Action"" mechanism at the lowest price, and when I looked at the various models for sale, it seemed that the major difference between them (that was not just gimmicks) was the number and types of brush heads that were included with each model. I figured that since these were expendables, I would be buying more of them over the years anyway.  In the end, the 7550 with the four brush heads that are included and 6 refills that I bought at the same time cost less than some of the fancier models with fewer heads.

Now clicking on a color choice will bring you a single product on the screen, which is better than a few weeks ago, when I bought mine.  I mistakenly thought that the shimmer of the Twilight Crush pillow was distorting the way the color appeared in the picture, and it was that pretty color of rose that the girl's holding.  Instead, it's a strange, shimmery green and burgundy red color, quite similar to the picture they have up now, but where the picture looks brown, it's actually much more red.  That shimmery  green is the dominant color, however, and the red is more of a ""background"" color.  In my opinion, it's not very pleasant to look at, but it smells good, and maybe I'll get used to the odd color combination.  If I could do it over, I'd go for the blue feather color choice...I'd also wondered why it has the funny little heart sewn onto the front of the pillow.

Neither one of them has lasted longer than three months (the package says to replace the heads every three to four months...think about it) The first one was great for a while, but water got into the battery compartment and caused the batteries to leak. I blamed it on myself and went out to buy a new one. I was extra careful not to get the bottom wet, which is interesting to do considering it is a product that is made to be used around water.

The following are points to consider, on their own they would not bother me but I'll mention them anyway:-The battery compartment, when working, is a little difficult to get open. -On the first brush I had no problem getting the power switch to slide up with wet hands, but on the second brush the switch went considerably harder and I need to put my hand inside a towel to turn the brush on. -As far as it's whitening properties, I don't know if it does that, I've never paid attention. It does keep my teeth clean though. On the other hand, my boyfriend bought his at the same time that I bought my first one, and his is still going strong.

So much, that you have to apply cream, lotion or body oil afterwards or your skin feels like it will crack? Or perhaps you're one of the millions who suffer from skin rashes, or chronic itching from dryness or allergic reaction to perfumes or dyes? Fret no more my friends, Kiss My Face Olive & Aloe Bar Soap is your answer. The skin is the largest organ of the body, and is ""naturally"" covered by an oily substance known as Sebum. This thin layer of oil, produced by the Sebaceaous glands, creates a barrier on the skin called the Acid Mantle, which serves several basic purposes. Because it is naturally acidic (ph of 4.5 avg), it protects the body from viral and bacterial infection, it acts as a barrier from internal dehydratyion, and the oily characteristic keeps the skin soft, supple and pliable. Yet, we in the Western world are taught to bathe everyday, and on top of that no-no, the vast majority of us bathe with harsh alkaline soaps and cleaners which strip away this oily barrier, leaving the skin dry, rough and unprotected. I won't mention any other major brands here, but suffice it to say that the greater the lather (lots of bubbles), the harsher the soap and the more alkaline. Daily use of these harsh soaps results in a billion dollar lotion, cream and moisturizer industry. Short of it; we buy harsh soaps (mostly because they are really inexpensive) and daily strip the oily barrier off, then buy lotions and slather a fake one on. Add to that, many people are truly allergy sensative to perfumes and dyes, and most of those name brand soaps are loaded with them.I don't imagine any of us wants to give up our daily shower, so from a professionals point of view, Kiss My Face Olive & Aloe Bar Soap is the answer. Neutral in ph, no perfumes or dyes, and no harsh surfactants to dry the skin out. Keep this in mind; anytime you ""clean"" your skin, you wash away the oily barrier. But better to gently clean your skin (and trust me, it will be just as clean) with Kiss My Face Olive & Aloe Bar Soap and maintain a natural ph balance to your skin, then to abuse, strip and dry out your skin and apply a fake oily barrier. Your skin will love you. I promise",5.0,positive

3241,B00005NAXG:hard_to_beat_showerhead_experience!:mitchell_loo,"I had previously tried Waterpik's other rain fall like showerhead the WaterPik CF-201.  It was horrible, the arm wouldn't hold its place and the one I recieved had this horrible leaking problem that was probably due to its largely plastic construction.With low expectations of the Waterpik brand, I stumbled upon this gem.  The JP-130 looked a lot sturdier than their other model.  Upon recieving it, my initial impressions were true, fantastic!  The chromed metal gave it a distinguishably elegant look that no plastic showerhead can give.  The swing arm actually, when adjusted properly actually stays where you want it!  The spray pattern is a very soothing gentle stream.  It doesn't pack a lot of pressurized punch like some other heads do.  But I wasn't looking for that.My only gripes if I had to point out any would be the need for possible a longer swing arm.  The 9"" arm is more than suitable for most people.  But I'm 6'1"" and it'd be nice to have a little more range.  I definitely couldn't imagine having to deal with a shorter swing arm.  Next, it's not really a problem, but I hope Waterpik eventually makes a newer model with an even wider head.  The 60 nozzles do a pretty good job of covering my entire body if I stand still, but moving around a little puts parts of my body out of the stream.  An extra 1"" or 2"" would be nice, an extra 3-4"" in diameter would be the superb!  Regardless of the other reviews, I didn't find adjusting the knobs as hard as other reviewers made it out to be, maybe it's just me?  After reading what others said, I expected to give each knob my ""death grip,"" but they didn't need it.Overall, you simply can't beat this showerhead for money.

It is estimated that over 50 million Americans suffer from some sort of insomnia. While we all have occasional nights when we struggle to fall asleep, nothing can describe the frustration of struggling to go to sleep night after night! Medical science recognizes the strong association between good health and good quality sleep. What is the best way to treat insomnia? Because of limited time and lack of understanding of the natural sleep cycle, many conventional doctors prescribe strong sleeping tablets for insomnia like Diazepam (Valium), Lorazapam, Alprazolam, etc. These can be highly addictive and if used for more than a week or two can result in a lifetime of dependence. Using strong drugs to fall asleep often means that the body's natural sleep cycle is disturbed and the ability to fall asleep naturally is lost. The person often needs to take stronger and stronger medication in order to fall asleep at night. Grogginess in the morning is not uncommon. Somnatrol is unlike any other product of its kind. The unique ingredients in this officially licensed Somnazide product when taken 30-60 minutes before bedtime will start relaxing your body. This feeling of relaxation is the formulas Stage 1 components taking effect. Shortly thereafter you are put into a restful sound sleep as the Stage 2 components take over. Somnatrol is a great way to end your day by both easing stress and supporting a restful night sleep. Mental and physical health depend upon the ability to relax and sleep without interruption",5.0,positive

I have mild asthma and I am heavily effected by Ozone (it makes me react badly to it) so part of the reason I bought this brand was it touted ""no ozone"" It does have an ionizer on it and those produce ozone. However, you can have it turned off at all times if you want. Even with it on my reactions to it are mild, I spoke to a rep at Rabbit Air who have 24/7 phone support and they told me it uses a low power ionizer so its not a smelly and intense Ozone generation. So for those with Asthma and Ozone sensativity you can turn off the ionizer! Also for those who are wondering the size it stands about  20 inches off the floor.Pros:-The charcoal/pre filters are washable in sink or dishwasher-The HEPA filter is coated with antiviral/antibacterial agent to last longer-1.5 year filter life with continuous use. -5 year Warranty-Very clear high tech looking front display -Body painted with anti electro-static coating to prevent dust build up-HEPA filter has a gasket on bottom edge perimeter to prevent air leakage-The Odor and Particle sensors on front actually function accurately. I would have thought it was a cheap gimmick but they actually work! Its a nice extra feature you don't see elsewhere. (when you buy one spray some air freshener or puff powder somewhere in middle of room and watch the odor/particle lights crank up shortly afterward)Cons: (small gripes, but not enough for me to effect 5 star rating, but if this was a 1 out of 10 scoring system. I'd give it a 9 or 9.5)-I dont have a problem with this but some people say front panel is to bright to have in bedroom. If you like perfect blank room then find a way to cover the display. No way to shut off front display other then power off.-The unit requires a remote control to get to all its higher functions. All you can do on the unit itself is turn power on/off. The remote uses over sized watch battery so it wont be something you have laying around the house as a spare backup.-The Ionizer turns itself on every time you select a new function on the remote (speeds and settings) So, you need to turn it back off everytime you change its settings (not a big deal)-Some people were surprised by its size. But after getting it its about mid thigh high. You can press it up against a wall if you want.. and since its a somewhat thin profile it takes up less floor space then thise giant square or round designs other air purifiers have.I am not sure if its worth the price yet.

Let's say you're eating a Popsicle--excuse me--a frozen fruit treat. You close your eyes, and the flavor clues are all but gone.

Otherwise, the two products, 'concentrated' and 'standard srength' are the same. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT - THIS IS CONCENTRATED & COMES OUT LIKE HEINZ KETCHUP:It does seem to be concentrated, and we did notice a certain amount of difficulty getting the detergent out of the bottle, kind of reminded us of Heinz ketchup.4-STAR or 5-STAR PRODUCT? The standard strength product is clearly a 5-STAR product, however owing to the fact that this product does not work as well without adding more detergent than the direction claim, it rates 4-STARs with our family.

THE FOLLOWING IS TRUE OF THIS PRODUCT IN STANDARD STRENGTH or 3X WITH EXTRA DETERGENT ADDED: I am allergic to most laundry detergents, but this product has prevented severe discomfort for me for about 10 years. It is consistently among the lowest-priced detergents available. In addition to being very easy on clothes and skin, it does work quite well in the stain-removal department and can be used as its own presoak. This is good to know if you are like me and are trying to avoid allergens. It is important to remember that if you buy a hypoallergenic powder detergent instead of a liquid like this, you may have to pre-soak stains and you won't have a hypoallergenic liquid with which to do it. While ""Tide"" and ""Cheer"" are also available in hypoallergenic formulas,[""Tide Free"" is actually just unscented] they are considerably more expensive and work no better in my experience. That's why I like this ""All Liquid Detergent - Free Clear, Laundry Detergent"". OBJECTIVE INFORMATION IS TOUGH TO FIND! I actually did conduct a hard target search for true, objective information on laundry detergents. There is very little beyond which brand causes pollution which, while important, is not what I was trying to find. ""Consumer Reports"" does have test comparisons of the most popular brands in its monthly magazine every couple of years and they do include some detail.

The skin renews itself approximately every 28 days. As we all age, this process can start to take twice as long. So, skin cells start to build up on the top layer of the skin. This causes a dehydrated, rough and dull complexion. Slower cell production, free radical damage and the breakdown of collagen and elastin encourages those little wrinkles to start to appear. You can start to use a vitamin C skin cream and hope for the best, but really you are still fighting all those dead skin cells which can clog pores and promote sebum build up (the cause of breakouts and blemishes). The best skin care regimen also includes exfoliation, topically applied antioxidants and sunscreen! Try the Vitamin C cream by Avalon Active Organics and CoQ10 Facial cleansing Crème. All the Zia products are most impressive. I'm quite in love with all the products I've tried so far. The Fresh Papaya Enzyme Peel is no exception. This is a smooth earthy almost scent-free green mask contains papain that is activated with water. Papain is a protein-digesting enzyme that dissolves dead skin cells without disturbing the live, healthy ones. It is found in unripened papaya fruit.  It is all natural, non-abrasive and is an exfoliant. It removes the dead surface skin on your face to give you a more even texture. Most traditional scrubs are too harsh and use granules to strip the top layer of skin, healthy cells and all. This can result in irritation and over-production of oil and even scarring. You cleanse your skin and then apply a small amount to your damp face. The enzyme is supposed to stay active for up to 1 hour. The first time you use this, you leave it on for 5-20 minutes. Then you increase the time to 40 minutes, etc. Before rinsing, you reapply some water and massage gently, then rinse off with warm water. It is recommended for use at last three times a week, but is gentle enough to use every day. You will notice a difference and a more vibrant look to your skin after using this product a few times. I've noticed that in dry weather the mask tends to dry a bit on my face, so keep a spray bottle of pure water handy to keep the mask moist. This is not a mask you want to let dry. When you go to a spa, they always have a steamer on your face during the enzyme treatment phase, so you might also want to use this product the same way. Just don't let this get in your eyes! Putting a saturated cotton pad over each eye might help.It contains: Green Papaya Concentrate, Sunflower Oil, Unfiltered Hawaiian Honey, Citrus Oil Extract, Vitamin E Acetate, Ceteareth 20, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Diazolidinyl Urea.Helps to repair sun damage, remove age spots and other discolorations. Also try the Zia Acne Treatment Mask which can be used for spot treatment or to help control breakouts. It contains Colloidal Sulphur, silica, Camphor and Tea Tree Essential oil. Look for the Pumpkin Exfloiating Mask and Citrus Night Time Reversal. Zia Products are cruelty free!  This product is a must for all skin types!~TheRebeccaReview.com",5.0,positive

The 2-way (two brightness levels) switch does not seem to be the most robust piece of hardware, but I'm pretty confident that it will hold up.  It did take some finagling to get the cover to fit perfectly over the bulb.  I imagine that this is a pretty high profit margin product for the Verilux folks as it's basically a really good fluorescent bulb (it gets very warm!) in a plastic housing.The first thing that most visitors to my office say is ""holy cow, that's a freakin' bright light.""Verilux also offers a 10,000 unit light.

Another great feature is the center balance. If you step on a scale and aren't centered, the weight can change greatly. On this scale, before your weight pops up, there are lines going across it. The side the lines are pointing to is the side with too much weight on it. If you see a small dot in the center, then you're standing on it correctly, and your weight will be accurate. Of course, other than the user settings, it is still an average scale, for someone who is interested in just getting their weight. I definitely think it's worth-while.",4.0,positive

I'm astonished at the negative review below and can only wonder if that reviewer and I are talking about the same item.  So glad I didn't let him/her put me off buying one of these.What's good about this fountain:  The mister came mostly assembled, so the assembly part was no problem; I was afraid the changing colours were going to look a bit cheesy, but in fact they are quite beautiful to watch; I have the mist adjuster set on high (it's a sort-of flap, and I have it pushed all the way up) and have experienced no puddles of water; the fountain makes a pleasant swirly mist, sort of like dry ice; it gives off a very soft gentle-spring-rain sound; it is a lot easier to clean than traditional tabletop fountains; it has a nice, sleek, modern design; the mister shuts off if the water level goes below what is recommended; it doesn't require frequent refills - once a day lasts a while; and it specifically states that tap water ONLY is to be used - no having to go to the shops for distilled or other water.I haven't yet tried the Pearlessence oils, but I have used The Body Shop's Home Fragrance Oils and they work really well. Six drops directly in the water gives off a pleasant scent within about a six-foot radius, but after a while the scent permeates a lot farther.  So, turn on the mister, put in your favourite scent, pour your preferred beverage, put on some soothing music, and turn down the lights.  If this doesn't relax you, you need professional help.February 22, 2007:  This is a follow-up to my earlier review.  I just received additional misters for work and for gifts.  They have changed the design, so my comments about the adjustable mister flap are no longer valid, because it isn't there any more.  It now comes with a small glass disk that I think is in place to keep water from spraying all over.  You'll still need to put the mister on a plate or tray, but it will, I think, avoid the possibility of getting large puddles of water underneath.  Also, the inner parts were now unassembled, but are so simple to put together, you'd have to be completely incapable of following instructions if you can't manage it.  In addition, if you plan to give one as a gift, open the box first - the bowl on one of mine arrived cracked in several places.  I still love my mister, though",5.0,positive

This is my first experience with any kind of electric shaver, so you may wish to take my review with a small grain of salt.The shaver itself is decent.  I find that my closest shave is still with a blade razor, but having curly hair was leading to razor burn and ingrown hairs.  I get a reasonably close shave without the burn.  It does miss hairs sometimes but if you go back and forth enough you eventually catch it all.  NOTE: If you're like me and only shave every couple of days don't let your hair get too long or the shaver won't be able to pick it up.  It's best for shaving stubble.  My one real complaint is sturdiness.  I've removed one star off the rating for this.

I am a physical therapist, and have over 5 years of experience dealing primarily with the mechanics and mechanisms of low back pain and disc dysfunction.  I have tried out many cushions over the years, and from my experience, this product is as good as any higher-priced product of the same intent.  The composite board insert allows for a consistent shape to be maintained, so the cushion does not yield as easily to body weight over years of consistent use, and the burgundy cover is removable and washable.  It is also an excellent size for the average-sized person (my dad is approximately 5'9"", ~170 lbs.).  It provides good side-bolster support as well for an added feeling of comfort around the outiside of the lower back.  I highly recommend this cushion when placed in comparison of other similar products.  Most of the other products out there that are in contention with this one are composed of unnecessary additives, like a massager, ribbing on the contours of the cushion, etc.  I've found that simply maintaining good posture (not only in sitting, but all activity) allows for so much more freedom from pain and simple ease back into daily life.  Again, I highly recommend this product to anyone out there searching for an answer to help alleviate low back pain; however, I must caution that commercial products are NOT a cure-all to one's problems.  It's always possible to alleviate the pain and symptoms, but other steps are necessary in terms of FIXING the problem.  I highly recommend seeking out professional care from a physical therapist, as it is more than likely necessary that one would need (at least) proper education and intevention to help one to get better.",5.0,positive

3720,"B000F97B6M:good_idea,_but_flawed_design:m._kreg","The idea is fantastic.  The fact is I don't wake up immediately like BZZZZ--I'm awake.  Amazingly I can hit the snooze on a regular alarm without ever knowing it.  On this alarm, the light starts glowing and gets brighter and brighter over a period of time you select.  I have mine set for 15 minutes, and usually by the time the light has reached maximum I'm coherent enough to get up.  If the light doesn't do it, you can add sounds ranging from a buzzer to screeching sea gulls--ocean, wind, and ringing bells falling somewhere in between.The flaws:  As others have mentioned, the light itself makes a buzzing noise at low light levels.  So when it first pops on in the morning, you also get the annoying filiment vibration of the lamp.  Secondly, you don't set the alarm for when you want to get up.  You have to go through some math calculations, figuring out when you WANT to wake up and how long it will take you to get to that point.  Then you set the alarm for that earlier time (awake minus groggy equals alarm time).  Third, if you use the sound in addition to the light, it does increase in volume as the light increases in intensity, but the sound starts out so loud to begin with that the light is really pointless.  A workaround we've found for this is to use the external speaker provided.  Plug it into the back of the light, run it across the room, and bury it upside down under some pillows.  Then pick a sound like ""Birds"" instead of the lip-curling ""Harbor"" or ""Town"".  From it's buried location across the room, the sound hits the right volume about the time the light maxes out.  Whoever came up with the plan of making the sound come on with the light was just not thinking.  Fourth, the clock lumination can change colors, rotating through the entire rainbow all night long in its default setting.  At first that looks cool.  Until you realize a bright yellow clock glowing in your face at 2 a.m. is just wrong.  The darkest setting is red, and the only way to choose it is to hit a pause button on the back when it rotates around to that color.So yes, it works.  And it wakes me up without making me use my hammer.  But the design is just plain stupid.

I have been sleeping on it every night since I bought it. It's been almost half a year and I still love it. This air bed is very comfortable and durable. I only  pumped air a few times in the past six months. An important thing to remember when you use any air bed is that an air bed is not an iron bed. An air bed is like a balloon, but in a much different shape. If you know how not make a balloon burst, you should do the same to your air bed though air beds are more durable. Before you pump up the bed, you've got to vacume your floor to make sure there is no hard and sharp particles which may prick your air bed and cause leaks. This is very important in extending the life of your air bed. I always take off my shoes at the door when I come into my house. So I have less chance of bringing sand, dust, dirt and so on into my house. As a result, my floor is clean. Still, I vacume it every now and then to maintain it. If you wear your shoes in your house, you should always make sure the floor space under your air bed is clean and free of sharp or hard particles of any kind. They may be so small  that you can't notice, but vacuming the floor is very helpful to prevent your air bed from being damaged",5.0,positive

3734,B0002U2YL6:worked_for_me...:katy_lake,"I was just looking for a way to get rid of the calluses on my feet, so I figured a foot spa was a good start.I've read various reviews elsewhere about foot spas, and the Dr. Scholl came up as a favorite, so I'd figure I'd try it.I'm not sure what people expect from foot spas, but I liked this one a lot. The unit has a lot of places to hold it, which is a big deal if you want to put water in it and move it to where you can get the thing to work. A lot of water can be VERY heavy, but you actually don't need much for this unit. There are lines on the interior for the amount, which is probably a few quarts at most.The unit has a plastic hood thing where the touch-toe controls are located. You can turn it to massage and a very nifty bubbles massager thing. The interior where you place your feet has all these nubby things on it, where you can do a little self-massage. There are also spaces on both foot recepticles where you can place two different foot massage attachments. One has a raised cylinder that spins when you rub your feet against it; it looks like something like a small hamster wheel. That one, I didn't like because it's so high you can't rest your feet at all in the water. The rubbing action didn't help at all. There's another insert with just nubs on it, like the nubs in the bottom of the foot spa. This is much more comfortable, and does what the nubs do: a good place to rub the soles of your feet.I used a peppermint foot bath additive that was okay (this is something I added; it's not included with the foot spa.) The additive was okay, not something I'd pay for again, but the bad thing about it was that it impeded my use of the bubble mechanism. Everytime I hit that, the peppermint stuff FOAMED up ridiculously and spilled out of the foot spa.That's a shame, because the nicest thing about this device is that bubble mechanism. it really IS a pleasant sensation (so next time, if I add anything to the foot bath, I'll make sure it's NON-foaming!)You have to put HOT water in this. The massage control also has a heat controller. It does NOT, as the directions say, make cold water hot. It does, however, keep hot water hotter longer. I used this for 20 minutes the first time around, and the very hot water I used was still nicely warm when I was through.Cleaning this is a bit of a bear. The blue shield that houses the control device and helps keep the water warm is not removable. That means you have to go slinging around inside the device to wash and dry it. Just a nuisance, and not enough to turn me off this foot spa.The cord is sufficently long, and it wraps around the elevated feet of the unit for storage.The only other thing I'd mention is when you wash it out, be SURE to tip it almost upside down to get rid of the water. The thin blue strip that runs down the center of each of the foot areas is where the bubbles come out; that seems to hold quite a bit of water even after you're done emptying it. Just turn it over and give it a good shake, and that'll take care of it.All in all, I'd recommend this. It's pleasant, it works well, and the softened calluses were easy for me to pumice off after a 20-minute soak.",5.0,positive

3737,B000F97B6M:verilux_rise_&_shine:_company_won't_back_warranty:newsview,"If you want my review in a nutshell, here it is: Two Defective Rise & Shine Lamps. One Call to Verilux. Verilux Refuses to Help.If you wish to learn how this sorry state of affairs came to pass, read on.My Verilux Product Experience:I exchanged my first Verilux Rise and Shine Natural Alarm Clock & Bedside Lamp due to a non-functional internal speaker, ostensibly from loose wires that were shaken loose during shipping (if I am to understand the Verilux' company president's response to a similar defect report in these reviews). The good news: The speaker in the second unit now works. And contrary to some of the other reviewers I feel the Mylar speaker sounds quite good -- although dual stereo speakers would have been an even better choice (with a line-in jack for CD player or iPod). The bad: Despite the jumbo LCD display that might lead you to assume that the AM/FM tuner is digital, the radio is completely analog. The station IDs are printed in roughly 7-point type on the tuning dial instead -- small enough that some owners will need their glasses AND a magnifying glass to select a radio station. By contrast, I own an alarm clock by Conair with a similar analog tuner, with the exception that it uses roughly 8-point LCD digits to represent the radio frequency in the lower right-hand corner of the backlit LCD display. On Verilux' comparatively enormous LCD, I am left to wonder why the design team failed to consider that option. An analog tuner without a station display is something I expect from a $15 drugstore alarm clock, but not from a product of this type, which is otherwise very well thought out.Unfortunately, due to an apparent flaw in the shade and/or the lamp itself, the shade on my replacement lamp -- the lamp I received from the store in exchange -- won't sit straight! One can remove the shade, look at the lamp on a level surface, and see the lamp ""shelf"" slope downward such that the shade itself also is similarly slanted! Making the situation worse, the lampshade is also slightly off insofar as the ring is not centered. There are three metal supports attached at the top of the shade that are bent downward and welded to a ring that sits about half way down (as typical of most lampshades). The ring, in turn, sits on the lamp body (or shelf). The whole assembly is cockeyed, including the socket into which the bulb sets (at a VERY obvious angle)! Cosmetically speaking, there are also problems that are surprising to see in a product of this type. Whereas the first lamp I purchased has a very prominent nick in the plastic edge alongside the LCD panel, the replacement lamp has a scratch in the ivory plastic lamp body about an inch below the shade shelf, and it, too, must have been obtained in manufacturing. As for the shade itself, it came out of the plastic wrap with a beige blemish, roughly 3/4"", that looks like a pale stain against the bright white linen. So while the second lamp did not have a DOA speaker, I apparently traded one problem in for another. Worse, the lamp appears lopsided even from the opposite side of the room (and would probably appear that way from down the street if I were to set it on the curb). In short, the Verilux Rise & Shine lamp is just not up to the quality that the price/warranty suggests. And in case you are wondering if this might have been ""gray market"" merchandise, it wasn't. I purchased my Rise & Shine lamp straight out of a high-end, authorized retail store, new-in-box. The AM/FM clock radio paired to the sunrise-simulating full-spectrum light, finished off by the eight high-quality digital nature sounds -- contained in a space-saving design roughly 6.5"" wide at the base and 20"" tall -- makes for an outstanding combination and concept. For this reason, I hope Verilux will continue to refine the Rise and Shine model, particularly where quality control is concerned. Given that I am a gadget fan, and someone who has rated products 1/5th the price of this lamp very highly, it should be understood that I really wanted to give this a positive review. But two duds in a row?IRONYThe Rise & Shine user manual emphatically instructs consumers to contact Verilux directly instead of returning defective products to the retailer. Given that my replacement lamp is also defective, I followed these instructions. But in reality, Verilux wants defective merchandise to become the retailers' problem, not theirs (as per the instruction I received to make a THIRD 40-mile trip back to the store where I purchased it). Conclusion?VERILUX DOESN'T BACK THEIR WARRANTY (in my experience/opinion).Nor, apparently, does Verilux care what kind of impression they leave on first-time customers. So if you think the impressive three-year warranty will help you if something should go wrong, consider what happened less than 72 hours into my ownership experience. And believe me, there was no rudeness involved to provoke this kind of reaction on the part of Verilux' customer service department, either.What Verilux has apparently forgotten is that this is the age of the Internet. As it so happens, I supplement my income writing product reviews for Websites. In fact, I am a writer by training/trade. Translation: Verilux chose the wrong customer to let down. I have no intention of smearing Verilux' reputation -- unless telling the truth and nothing but the truth about my experience qualifies as such.Would I recommend this product to a friend? Yesterday I might have said yes, chalking up the non-operative speaker in the first lamp to a fluke. Today, coupled with the fact that Verilux seemingly does not wish to stand behind their products even when it would take a mere lampshade to keep a customer happy, my answer is a resounding NO.Should anyone at Verilux read my review, I wish to close with this thought: I could have learned to live with the cosmetic problems I noted, but a ~$5 lampshade, to replace the one that was blemished right out of the box -- and doesn't sit straight, to boot -- is that not worth keeping a first-time customer happy?",2.0,negative

And I can always turn it down to the low setting if I need to.  It also has a cool setting to set your curls.

3838,"B00022WA9K:loud,_hot,_and_doesn't_do_the_job:liora_hess","I thought this hot air brush would make things easier by not having to hold a round brush and blow dryer. It's a great idea, but it just doesn't work as well as that. First let me say I have shoulder length, normal hair, but a lot of it. If I air dry, it is slightly wavy. I used the larger of the two brushes and found it couldn't get through my hair. So then I was using a second hand to try to push the hair against the brush so it would curl around it. That didn't work very well, and I wound up burning my hands more than once. I also found that I couldn't get the same nice curl with this hot air brush that I could get by using a regular round brush and dryer. The other major problem was that the brush got extremely hot. If you have an idea that you'll be able to change from the larger brush size to smaller (or the unit without the attachment) or vice versa, you won't without getting burned. The attachment--even the end of the blow dryer itself--is simply too hot to touch. I was doing things like using a hand towel to try to change attachments. The size and shape of the unit is also not optimal. I found it too large and awkward to use. The off button is located right where your hand is, so it's easy to bump. Also, there's no cold shot. If you've come to appreciate what that can do for setting a curl, you'll probably miss it like I did. Additionally, as another person has mentioned, the unit is very loud. You would be wise to buy a couple foam ear plugs if you are determined to keep this brush and keep your hearing. I don't believe I read any warning about the noise, either. It's much louder than my traditional guy-style blow dryer. Time wise, I found that I spent much longer trying to get my hair dry, and then I wasn't fully satisfied with the style as well as the burns and hassle involved in getting there. I gave this a try for a few days and then returned it to the store for a refund. It made me appreciate the traditional blow dryer and round brush.

Ibuprofen is the generic drug name,and is the active ingredient in Advil and Motrin. It comes in 200 milligam tablets/capsules. For most mild aches, it can be quite effective. Not only does Ibuprofen relieve pain, but it also is a real good anti-inflammatory medication (it lessens swelling). Thus it is also good for arthritis pain, any joint or muscle sprains or strains, and real good for toothache pain too. If two tablets are taken, it is equivalent to the previously by prescription only product, ""Motrin"". Two tablets, or 400 mg of Ibuprofen is for mild to moderate pain. Three tablets, 600 mg, is for moderate to moderately severe pain. All three doses, 200, 400, and 600 mg can be taken every 4 hours as needed for pain. Four tablets is the highest prescribed dose (800 mg), and should only be taken once every 6 hours. Reserve the four tablet dosaging for your really severe pain. The 800mg dose is equivalent to Tylenol #3 (anetaminophen with codiene), another good pain reliever. How you purchase Ibuprofen is up to you, but there are some real good generic Ibuprofen products that are less than half the cost of the ""name brand"" products (Advil, Motrin). Both the generic and the name brand are equal in terms of strength and effectiveness. The only thing different about the name brand is fancier packaging and perhaps easier to swallow dose forms.

The unit is compact, very sturdy, virtually silent, and puts out plenty of mist even on the low setting. The small tank is light and easy to fill, even in a bathroom sink (many people really have to wrestle with those one gallon tanks) yet it easilly lasts through an 8 hour work day or nights sleep. The key feature is that it is small and quiet. That means it can be near you on a desk top or night table. Having the mist nearer to you and less in the ambient air means less will condense on cold windows (and cause mildew). It also means you can use the low setting which makes the small tank last longer and reduces any risk of vapor droplets settling to the table top. If you want to use the high setting, put the unit on top of a book shelf, dresser or file cabnit to allow a longer path for the mist to settle. This is small and light enough to take on the road to dry hotel rooms. One daughter wants one for her dorm room, which is overheated. The unit is easily moved from bedroom to den or wherever you locate during the day. You would not find this convenient with large (gallon) humidifiers. This unit is also inexpensive, at around $30 which is half the cost of many larger models (so you can get two). After using several evaporative humidifiers, I love not spending $6 - $9 a month for paper replacement wicks. Overall, I am delighted with the unit. The only criticsm is the blue LED is too bright in a dark room. This is easily dimmed by putting a piece of masking or adhesive tape over it. The light is helpful to avoid bumping the unit if you reach for the phone or a tissue in the dark of night. It also lights up the mist so you know there is still water in the chamber.

So good, in fact, that when I got home I went straight to the web site show on the back of the wrapper to learn where I could buy them.  Just above the web address is the nutrition and ingredients list.  That was probably a mistake on the manufacturer's part as it gives you something to read while the site comes up.  OOPS!  This bar has a whooping 25% of your daily allowance of saturated fat!  Not only that, but the fat is palm oil.This might be acceptable for a soldier involved in prolonged strenuous activity but I doubt a cardiologist would recomend it to most of us.  A commercially formulated product is more likely to fill the average person's need for a lower fat (and healthier fat) energy bar, than one formulated for extreme physical activity, sold for profit and marketed as a patriotic tribute to the troops.

Well, these are colorless, fluorescent chemicals that biodegrade slowly.

Borax and table salt are generally mined (the company doesn't mention how they obtain these chemicals--they should), and the fragrance-free detergent contains a fragrance (! ) --citrus oil--albeit a natural one.

Many of my friends said they got the best shave ever using it: No razor burn, bumps, or nicks etc.  However, the M3 gave me more razor burn and nicks than any razor I've ever used! Could it have been that I wasn't used to the Mach 3 blades after using a Quattro for years?  To rule out blade differences, I subsequently tried the Power Quattro and obtained similar, albeit less drastic, negative results.  In particular, both the M3 and Power Quattro really did a number on my neck area.  I even had people comment on how abused my neck looked after shaving with these two razors.  Both Gillette and Schick assert that vibrations diminish irritation and lead to a superior shave.  In my case, I believe that vibrations actually lead to more irritation!My personal experience with these razors, and my cynical nature, lead me to believe that vibrating razors are just another ploy by the shaving industry to get people to buy more product (i.e., aftershave creams and lotions to cover up the mess that such razors create).

I was a little reluctant after reading some of the other reviews, but my friend and neighbor, Cheryl, swore by it. She had bought a similar product a few months ago and was really disappointed with it - so when she tried this one and said it was wonderful, I went ahead and ordered it based solely on her recommendation. I am so particular about my feet that I even trim my own nails before I get a pedicure! I only have a pedicure to get the dead skin off of my feet, have them smoothed and to enjoy the experience. (I live in the desert and I wear sandals most of the time.) So I would say I'm a pretty tough cookie to please. I got my heel smoother yesterday and couldn't wait to try it. It was perfect! In fact I just called Cheryl to thank her for turning me on to it. I love it so much I think I'm going to get them for my mom and my sister for the holidays. I usually pay between $28 - $40 for a pedicure - so after just ONE use, this has paid for itself and I'm ahead of the game!It took off all the dead skin and it didn't hurt at all. The unit was powerful enough without being scary (as when I tried a dremel tool a few years ago - a disaster!) It was actually easy to access my heels with this instrument...I like the way it's shaped and it's lightweight. I was really surprised at how efficient it is. The cream that comes with it is great, too. I put it on before bed and could really feel a difference this morning. I sold cosmetics about 25 years ago and I know a keeper when I see one. This is awesome. I could have sold a ton of these if they were around back then. I believe in the expression ""If you like what we do, tell a friend....If you DON'T like what we do, tell US."" I live by that - believing that as a business owner, we would want to know if something wasn't good. Consequently, I always say when something isn't great, (particularly food or service at a restaurant - since I wrote the book on Business Lunches!)  so I also feel the need to share my opinion when I find something that is really super and does what it says it will do. I wholeheartedly recommend this. If you want your heels to look and feel nice, smooth and keep them from cracking, polish them down with this fabulous instrument.

4015,531906,"I'm cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  I'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I've finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I've finally found the right one.I've used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They've gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn't take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don't work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I'd have a five-o'clock shadow around 2PM.So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it's more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I've ever tried.  Highly recommended",5.0,positive

The seeds contain fatty oils called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid. ALA is the omega-3 oil in flaxseed. Flaxseed contains both omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids. Flaxseed is nature's richest storehouse of omega-3 fatty acids, and contains more than twice as much omega-3 oil as fish oils, and it costs less , ounce for ounce. Flax also contains other important substances like lignans, which may protect against some types of cancer. The husks of the seeds are rich in mucilage. Both the seed oil and mucilage have many nutritional and therapeutic properties. There are many potential benefits from taking Flax seed oil:Flaxseed Oil lowers cholesterol levels, thereby improving cardiovascular health and lessening the risk of arteriosclerosis. Flaxseed also contains plant nutrients like phytoestrogens. These are natural estrogen-like substances that can lessen the discomfort of menopause.Flaxseed oil may lower high blood pressure.Flaxseed oil helps some people improve their psoriasis and eczema, as it has anti-inflammatory properties. Flaxseed may also reduce the itching, swelling, and redness associated with certain skin disorders such as acne.Flaxseed oil has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis due to its ability to calm inflammation. Flaxseed reduces LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (the body's ""bad cholesterol"") and lowers triglyceride levels. Research shows that flaxseed oil gives much better protection against heart attacks than canola oil or olive oil. Taking flaxseed may reduce cancer risk. This is because flaxseed contains the richest sources of lignan building blocks, which play a major role in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer. New research indicates that the lignans in flaxseed have both short-term and long-term protective effects against colon cancer. Nature Made Flaxseed Oil is a quality source of flaxseed oil, as the company is well-known and reputable. One tip: keep your flaxseed oil away from light and heat, as both degrade the oil. The usual beneficial dose of Flaxseed Oil is 2-3 capsules once per day taken with a meal.  Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig",5.0,positive

Also, when making any movements, the compression of the foam, and the friction between it and the fabric covering, made really annoying noises.

The Backrest was even worse than the Seat Cushion because it had a thin plastic wrapping (looked sort of like shrink wrap or Saran wrap) around the foam inside, which made loud crinkling noises every time I even twitched.

The tub & tile pads need to be moistened prior to use and then the soap needs to be rinsed.  The mopping pads are pre-moistened and can be left to dry.  Reading the instructions helps you figure this out quickly, but I guess its easier to skip that step and then get angry and write one star reviews.  Maybe that's more satisfying.  Its true that the mop pads can drip a few drops as you put them on the device.  Somehow getting a few drops of cleaning solution on the surface you're about to mop doesn't seem like a problem, but what do I know?

It's based on specific traits of specific plants and flowers, which are incredibly concentrated and potent in their distilled form. If the substance you're smelling isn't a pure essential oil, or is adulterated with synthetic perfumes, it's not therapy. It's just aroma.A good, inexpensive alternative is to pick up 2 or 3 pure EOs from your local health store. A good start- Lavender, Peppermint, Eucalyptus, Lemon.

Sure it looks nice, but if it doesn't do its job, it's not much of an accessory for the bathroom.It took me a while to figure out how the scale works.  There are a lot of beeps involved.  Essentially, to program your info, you start by pressing the mode button, adjust your height, press mode, adjust your age, press mode, select your gender, press mode, select between normal and athlete, press mode and you will hear a beep to confirm. Then to store, press either the up button for memory #s 1,3 and 5 or the down button for #s 2,4 and 6, press mode and there will be another beep to confirm.Still with me?  If you just want your weight, you just step on the scale, but if you want to get your body fat and water %, you must press the up or down button to find your memory #, then press mode and wait for the beep before you step on the scale.Now I don't know about you, but this procedure is a lot more cumbersome than any other scale I owned.  So fine, I've now figured out how to work the thing.  Getting even somewhat accurate results are another thing.When I stepped on the scale, I would sometimes be surprised by the weight.  I didn't think I could gain 7 pounds in one day (I eat very healthy and my weight range is usually between 3-4 pounds).  But if you step on the scale again, like some other digital scales, it seems to remember your last weight and won't give you your real weight.  So I have to put some other object on it to get a reading and then the scale resets.  I step on the scale again and my weight is now 6 pounds less than the original reading!The body water % didn't fluctuate too much and the body fat % was 3% higher than the reading on the last scale I owned (Conair Thinner brand).

Mixing it together without a blender causes it to clump something awful, so a blender is definitely essential. I recommend pouring how much milk you intend to drink in the your designated drinking vessel first before you blend; the shake has a tendency to froth and this way you don't end up with excess sitting in the blender.

If you're used to using something like a Mach 3 (as that was my first wet shave razor)or any of the multi-blades this will take some getting used to.  Small easy strokes with absolutely no pressure except by the weight of this razor are the way to go.  Do one stroke with one side, another stroke with the other then rense.  One pass with the grain for most is the way to go but if you desire a closer shave then I suggest re-lather, (which is important for wetshaving) and lightly shave across, not against the grain.  For those wanting a good shave, you will have to spend a little more time than using the multiblade razors.  I suggest a badger hair brush with some traditional shave cream or soap like Geo F. Trumpers or Trufitt or Taylor of Old Bond Street.  Plan on no less than five minutes for a good close shave from the start of lathering to toweling off.  I also suggest a skin food from Trumpers or some preshave oil from The Art of Shaving that will help the razor glide.  I enjoy this razor way more than any multi-blade and I think any user who will take the time to learn to use it will to.

Photodamage is the damage that the sun does to your skin symptoms of which are brown spots, wrinkles and such. Only two sunscreen ingredients protect against the long UVAI rays that cause photodamage; zinc oxide and Parsol 1789. Zinc Oxide protects a broader range of these rays than does Parsol 1789. This sunscreen has Parsol 1789 (Avobenzone). It's good, and certainly offers more photo damage protection than most, but a sunscreen with zinc oxide would be better still. Zinc Oxide is also less irritating, it's even found in some baby care products.  Because Parsol 1789 is a chemical rather than a physical sunscreen like Zinc Oxide, some may experience irritation with Neutrogena Dry Touch.This Neutrogena goes on very smooth and dry and you can't even tell you are wearing suncscreen. This is very nice, although it does have a bit of a scent which I don't like (I would prefer it be non scented, I don't like smelling like soap-Neutrogena, are you listening?). All in all, for the money this is good sunscreen for either your face or your body and it is particularly good for oily skin as it will make your skin seem less oily.But if you are willing to spend a bit more money, check out a zinc oxide sunscreen such as Skinceuticals Ultimate 30 which offers a bit more protection and is less irritating (zinc oxide is less irritating that Parsol 1789).

I myself prefer cloth diapers, but because we have a high water table if we do much laundry our septic backs up into our house - yuck! I am also severely chemically sensitive and so the scent on ""normal"" diapers and even the Seventh Generations ones that have gel make me ill. But these are great!! They are made of wood pulp/paper and do feel as if there were cotton in them. They have no chemical scent at all and feel nice and soft and smooth to my fingers. They close by means of an adhesive strip on either side that closes onto a larger piece of thin plastic on either side. If you accidentally close the adhesive strip on the paper it will tear when you pull it back off and usually not reseal. This is not a problem if you use them only once. We potty our baby and so sometimes we take it off and put it back on a few times before it gets wet or dirty. Other than accidentally sticking the strips to the paper I haven't had another problem with using them like this. There is elastic at the legs but it is basically encased so that it isn't in contact with the skin and they are snug enough on my baby's legs. These are a little harder to tell if they are wet than the seventh generation ones (I've never used regular diapers since I can't get near them with their chemical scent) because there isn't a gel. I usually just put a finger on it and then touch that finger to my thumb and then I can tell if I feel dampness or not. If my baby pees a lot though it is easy to tell if it is wet...even from the outside because it will look a little more molded in form, but does not feel damp on the outside and the inside is less damp even then than in a cloth diaper.The packaging says that you should not let the baby put these in his/her mouth since it is paper and can tear off in their mouth and that it should not be held near a flame - again because it is made out of paper. But all that said, these are not flimsy at all, they are well made and hold up just as well as a regular disposable.

4236,405594,"I finally received this product in the mail after knowing about it for a year. I can't say I'm a huge fan of Deepak Chopra. He presents some good ideas, but from what I can tell he seems to consider meditation to be more of a mechanism for mind and body control, leading to bliss and relaxation, rather than a tool for unbiased self knowledge, to come to terms with all the things that one rather might ignore. I find this bias is reflected in the game. As a game in itself, it is pretty good -  its graphics and its originality - and learning to relax and chill out may be useful for some people. I didn't find the process as compelling as I expected, though. I found I was able to learn some of the skills pretty fast, and other places I seemed to get stuck. One potential drawback is that if you get frustrated, and try to start forcing things to happen, it can defeat the purpose of meditation.The science of biofeedback is fairly new, and I can see its potential in the field of preventative health.

4237,254442,"I'm cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  I'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I've finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I've finally found the right one.I've used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They've gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn't take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don't work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I'd have a five-o'clock shadow around 2PM.So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it's more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I've ever tried.  Highly recommended",5.0,positive

I was unable to find anything in this bar that implied it was artificial, which is an even bigger plus.One thing that confused me a little is that the bar is advertised to have no wheat and no dairy, but the label on the bar states that there may be trace amounts of dairy.  I guess they either knew there might be a very small amount of dairy or they were hedging themselves because of possible cross-contamination from some other process.  In either case, vegens consider whether trace amounts of dairy makes this an acceptable product.

4256,"B000FEGUIM:great_shave,_light,_easy_clean_up,_slow_to_charge:john_d._hatch","I've used Norelco shavers for years and I like them. After about 4 years my most recent Norelco stopped holding a charge, so I picked up this one.Pros:* It gives a great shave! They've changed the heads a bit and added some holes. Whatever it is, my shave is about 30% smoother better than my older Norelco and with less time.* It's quiet. I can actually have a conversation with my wife while shaving. This wasn't possible with my older shaver.* It is significanly lighter than my older model.* Cleanup is really easy. You just flush the head with hot water once a week. Once a month or so you're supposed to take out the shaving disks in the head and brush them clean but my guess is that once a quarter would be plenty. Since cleanup is a major hassle, this is a terrific feature.Cons:* It takes 8 hours to charge. Yikes! Eight hours. My old shaver never took over an hour.* It's hard to tell how much charge you have left. My older model had a gas gauge type indicator right on the front. This one just has a green light that goes on when you turn on the razor. When it runs low on juice you'll get a flashing red light when you finish shaving. This isn't nearly as handy.* The shape isn't as ergonomic as the other model probably because of the water rinsing feature. There are little plastic fins that stick out from the handle presumably to help you hold on when it's wet. It doesn't feel very good in your hand.* There is no case to store it in. This is a drawback if you use it to travel.* The head is supposed to be replaced once a year. Huh??? This is apparently the case on all new Norelco shavers. These heads aren't cheap, folks. I certainly wouldn't replace one unless I was having problems with the shaver -- and then I'd probably buy a new one.The bottom line is that I'm very pleased with this shaver. It does the job very well and it was quite inexpensive. I would certainly recommend this model over the higher end models if price is a consideration",4.0,positive
4257,B00009KGGI:not_for_natural_or_acrylic_nails:liora_hess,"This thing comes with lots of attachments, of which I regularly used only 2. The vibrating cuticle pusher is silly. As far as all those round discs, it's hard to explain the physics of this, but suffice it to say that since it's a rotating circle, you can only use half of it at a time or you'll experience a bump-bump-bump. The thing rotates at such a speed (even the lowest of the two speeds) that even leaving on your toe or finger for a moment or two can create a burning sensation. What I did use was the smallest pointed attachment, which I used to lightly go around my nail close to the cuticle. This was good for when you're wearing clear nail polish and your nails are starting to grow out. You can lightly buff down that ridge of polish. Same goes for the edge where acrylic meets the natural nail. The other attachment I used, though less frequently, is the bigger cone-shaped one (kind of looks like the shape of a foam ear plug). That I used to lightly go over my largest toenails to thin them down since I have trouble with ingrown toenails. Again, it's a challenge not to create burn when doing so. The nail dryer thing is silly and useless. If you manage to cram your hand into that little scoop without smudging the polish, it doesn't do much anyway to dry your nails any faster than just letting them set. Buy a little fan like they use in the shops if you want faster drying time. This thing isn't gonna do it. Other folks mentioned this thing ruined their nails. It's likely because they tried to use all of the attachments (which you'd think you should be able to do, right?). Much regular buffing on your nail thins it down and weakens it too much. The bump-bump-bump of the round attachments likely doesn't help, either. A couple times I used this for acrylic nails. I have a tendency to wear acrylic nails a few weeks and then hate them and want them removed---and I'm no longer willing to subject myself to the soak-and-pry method done in the nail salons. So the alternative was soak at home, or just trim down myself and then thin them to a more natural curved shape until the rest of the acrylic grew out. However, I mention I did this only a couple times. That's because apparently acrylics are a bit too much of a challenge for this little ""Deluxe Manicure System."" After sounding like it was ailing while it filed down the length of 2 acrylic nails, it gave a little bzz and then died. I waited a while to see if maybe it overheated. I tried other outlets. Nope, dead. So I'd pronounce this unfit for natural or acrylic nails. If you want something of quality for acrylic nails, invest in the Dremel tools that the salons use (just be sure to get one with a low RPM or foot pedal attachment). If you want something of quality for natural nails, go to the drug store and get some sandpaper nail files, a rectangular buffer, and a cuticle pusher. Sometimes the best solution is the simplest.",2.0,negative

4259,B00081NENQ:mine_broke_the_first_day:diamond_d,"I bought this cushion because I had to move from California to New York and expected the drive to be torture on my back. I researched these types of cushions and decided to get this one because it has a lot of motors compared to cheaper units, and because I had recently bought a Mogu pillow and really liked the soft feel of it--this cushion has ""Sqush,"" which has a similar feel.The cushion has a middle portion of Sqush which is concentrated into 3 ""lumps""--at your shoulders, lower back, and under the front part of your thighs, near your knees. The lumps are soft and squishy and are covered in a spandex-like material. The rest of the cushion feels like fleece.When I first plugged it in, I was immediately disappointed in the weakness of the wimpy motors. Even at the highest intensity (I never even bother with the lower two), it felt like nothing more that a moderate vibration--definitely not enough to un-knot an aching back. The pre-set programs are fine but I rarely use them. It comes with straps but I had a hard time trying to install it in my car because the instructions were non-existent and it wasn't intuitive at all. I ended up just attaching them to some hardware on the underside of the chair, which worked well.I can't decide if the cushion made the drive any more bearable. The lower back cushioning filled my lumbar region fine but the shoulder padding must be too thick because it pushed my shoulders forward and forced me into a slight hunched position which strained my back and made it hurt. The thigh cushioning made it slightly difficult to slide into the seat because it effectively raises the level of the seat (my car doesn't have fancy seat controls) and I had to wedge myself into the seat. The massaging feature was helpful because it was a fun thing to do on a boring drive and it helped a little to keep the circulation going, but it simply wasn't powerful enough to be really effective. The worse thing is that the thigh motor DIED only a few hours into my trip!! It has a 2 year warranty, but you have to pay a $5 ""handling"" fee! I'm mad at myself for throwing away the box because if I hadn't, I'd return it to Amazon and wash my hands of it.Overall, this cushion is underpowered, unreliable, and not as orthopedically correct as it should be. It is definitely not worth the outrageous price. I regret not buying a simple lumbar cushion instead. I wish I had saved my money for Homedic's highly rated Shiatsu seat cushion instead, although I'm somewhat leary of their product reliability now",2.0,negative

4318,B000HWHZ54:lots_of_extras_for_the_money:r._carr,"When I researched this walker for my 82 years young mother, this is the description I found in the publication ""Nursing Homes"":'HUGO is an ergonomically designed rolling walker with a seat designed by the Georgia Tech Research Institute and distributed by Access Product Marketing. HUGO features oversize nonskid wheels for navigation on any terrain. It weighs 16.5 lbs and can be folded and stored in a closet or car trunk. Hand brakes, a padded seat, and a backrest allow users to stop and rest. A detachable vinyl bag can transport mail, magazines, or groceries.'My mother really likes this walker particularly because of all the stowage compartments. In addition to the vinyl bag that attaches to the backrest, there is a sizeable compartment beneath the padded seat, which also has both netted and zip compartments on either side. The only desired accessory that is missing is a cup/drink holder.The walker is well made and the ergnomic handles make it easy and comfortable for arthritic hands to grip and maneuver.The large 8"" wheels give more stability when maneuvering over uneven sidewalks or rough surfaces like gravel or lawn. The swivel wheels allow for easier steering around corners and turning around in tight places.The brake grips are set just close enough for the forefingers to keep hold of (without braking) while the palm of the hands rest comfortably onthe handles. The brakes catch with an easy squeeze of the brake grips and hold securely in place when applied. A simple push downward of the brake grips, lock the brakes in place. They also unlock easily for those with arthritic hands.The seat is comfortably padded, but not very large. It's enough for my 120 pound mom; I do not know if it would really comfortable seat for someone say, 180-200+ pounds...may be enough for a very short term seating.It folds up, but not flat, so it will easily fill up a small trunk--something to keep in mind on shopping forays.With all the accessories and the quality of manufacturing & design, the HUGO Premium Rollng Walker very reasonably priced at $116.99 and free S&H.  We have paid far more for less. My mom's first walker was a basic no frills, no wheels, no seat. By the time I accessorized it with swivel wheels, seat, drink holder, storage compartments, ecetera, I'd spent about $200+. As most health aids tend to be dreary gray/black/white colors, it's a pleasant suprise to see walkers being made in bright cheerful colors! This really should be the standard for all health aids--particularly for those used at hospitals, hospices, and nursing homes. The hot cranberry color of this walker makes its appearance much more appealing & upbeat for the user!",5.0,positive

After looking for one both in town (San Diego) and on the Internet, I decided to just buy a new trimmer all together. At this point, I began to do some research. Originally, I looked exclusively at Norelco trimmers though my rational was solely based on name recognition. After reading many reviews and comparing prices, I decided to look at other brands as well. That is when I came across the Panasonic ER224S. The reviews for this product were overall excellent, and the price was appealing as well: only 5 dollars more than my old Norelco when bought at Best Buy. Before we proceed, I should let you know that I am more of a beard growing enthusiast than a beard growing professional. While I have been growing a beard for about a year now, I don't now, nor have I ever had aspirations to have a ZZ Top caliber beard. With that said, for my needs, this beard trimmer does everything I could hope for. This trimmer improves over my old Norelco in so many ways. The adjustment setter has 14 settings for a beard length up to 20 mm over the 9 setting my old Norelco offered, and the setting becomes locked once you power the trimmer on. There is an additional detail trimmer that offers the flexibility that my old Norelco could never offer, and it hides away when you aren't using it. The ER224S also allows you to operate the trimmer while it's charging. This was something that drove me nuts concerning my old Norelco. It's just as quiet as any other trimmer out there and in my opinion, it's the best looking trimmer you can buy. It simply looks classy.It doesn't have a built-in vacuum, but I really don't see that as necessary. From what I have read, they most often break or the performance is sub-standard. In the grand scheme of things, how difficult is it to rinse out the sink after you are done? The trimmer is also rather easy to clean. And the manual was very thorough explaining the ins and outs of the trimmer.In fact, the only con I can think of for this product is the rather large charger. However, I trim my beard 2-3 times a week, and the charge seems to keep for quite some time. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase",5.0,positive

The length of my hair seemed to have reached a plateau just below my shoulders and after year seemed to have grown no longer.  I decided to try this product to see if it worked.  As hair growth is normally clocked at an 1/8 of an inch per month, I decided to monitor the results in my own little ""clinical test.""  This was actually pretty easy because I colour my hair so I'd easily be able to see how much growth there was each month.  I ordered a box of Viviscal for which I paid $49 for (average price on the web) and the was set to take the first pill the following morning (the box recommends 2 per day).  I coloured my hair the night before so that in one month I'd be able to accurately measure how much growth there had been by looking at the growth since the colouring.Results:I didn't really notice anything until around the 2 week time frame.  I noticed my nails were growing very fast/very long.  I have weak nails that split easily and they barely seem to grow at all.  It was very noticeable because I use the computer all day and the nail growth was causing my fingers to constantly slip on the keyboard.  Never having great nails, I was pretty happy to see this.  My curiosity was also getting the better of me as I could see the roots of my hair pretty clearly which was unusual at 2 weeks after coloring.  I took the tape measure and measured almost 1/4 of an inch in hair growth.  This would mean 1/2 inch per month and 6 inches per year.  I was pretty excited because although the numbers seemed small, it was twice the rate my hair normally grows.  But I also noticed something else.  My hair was becoming unusually greasy.  Because I have very dry hair, I normally only wash it 2-3 times a week.  But every other day it seemed much more greasy than normal.  Hmmm.Well, at the 1 month time frame I measured my hair growth and it was exactly 3/4 of an inch.  Not only that but I was constantly trimming my nails at this point.  I was totally ecstatic.  But also by this point, I was washing my hair every day - it was no longer dry and brittle, it was much softer, but there was no way I could miss a day of washing it or it would be greasy.So - the conclusions I have reached from my test was this:1.  Yes, Viviscal works.  It caused my hair growth to be stimulated at over twice the speed.2.  Viviscal also makes your nails much stronger and grow much faster.3.  Viviscal makes your hair greasy, causing you to have to wash it every day - and then it's fine.It did not cause any extra hair growth anywhere else, which I thought a bit strange (though good!!!).I recommend this product",5.0,positive

As such, I am very knowledgeable about chemistry and the human body in general.  I really like Neutragena products and this product is certainly very high quality.  For most people, I think it offers great protection, but not the best protection for people who need to be very conscious of sun exposure and the possibility of skin cancer.According to my dermatologist, recent studies have shown that SPF 15-30 wipes off after a few hours and doesn't offer adequate protection after that time.  This is partly due to most people not using enough.  In other words, they underestimate how much they need to apply to get that level of protection.For this reason, Neutrogena SPF 45 or 55 is better.  Also, the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer products have been updated to include a technology called Helioplex.  Most dermatologists that I know feel that this makes a difference in effectiveness and for some people this is going to be very important.I have used both this product and the higher SPF Helioplex formulations.  In practice, I have found BOTH adequate for my needs.  What I particularly like is that you don't even know you have the product on.  It has virtually no scent and it really is so sheer you can't even notice it.  Both of these products stay on a long time and are good for all day use, but my understanding is that the Helioplex formulation is even better.  Further, it feels exactly the same on the skin.  The only drawback is it's a bit more expensive.This is also a good product because it protects against both UVA and UVB rays.  Both are implicated in skin cancer and it's important to protect yourself against both.  If you are looking for an everyday sunscreen this might be the one.  However, if you want the very best protection try the Neutrogena Helioplex SPF 55.  This will give you the most peace of mind",5.0,positive

The rest is couture history and today his clothing is worn by the very fashionable. Miyake brought the same exuberance to the creation of his fragrance that he brought to his designs. While it is a floral essence, it is enhanced with a variety of flower scents: lotus, cyclamen, freesia, carnations, white lilies. Base notes are sandalwood, moss and cedar.

The lowest setting was not sufficient, but I found a setting about halfway up the dial (260) that works very well.  Because of the way you can customize the settings, this straightener is suitable for all hair types.  It heats up in about ten seconds.

So it can be stored in a cupboard or any other spot away from the sink area, just wherever it's convenient for YOU.

4459,B000G7WRDU:far_cheaper_(and_more_convenient)_than_buying_it_piecemeal._great_kit!:t._hassler,"Doug Ritter and his foundation, Equipped to Survive, has come up with a very economic method to equip yourself and your family with an emergency kit. It is small enough to carry unnoticed in a pocket, yet fully functional.Although you can control the amount of certain items if you put together your own kit (something of a rite of passage among the survivalists/emergency preparedness folk), I spent twice as much putting together a comparable kit. The military issue sparklite and tinder-quick, Fox-40 whistle, and Rescue Flash signal mirror alone could cover the cost of the kit and they are all top notch gear. This pack is extremely high quality through and through, from choice of equipment to packing and instructions. I recommend looking at the ETS website at the slideshow of how such a kit is put together and what Doug Ritter himself recommends that you add to the kit (the pouch can hold a few more small items such as water purification tabs).The Pocket Survival Pack is an amazing value. I've purchased all of the items separately, and just the shipping or driving to pick up 3 or 4 of the items probably covers half the cost! If you are lucky enough to get everything at one store, you'd be hard pressed to get the entire kit as cheap as this. I know people who have purchased this kit to take the parts for their own self-built survival kits! That's how economical it is. Plus, if you buy this PSP, a portion of the proceeds goes to the ETS non-profit group which gives free survival consulting to deployed troops and is actively involved in improving survival equipment and standards. In fact, Doug Ritter is the only consumer advocate working with the governing body on personal locator beacons used in marine, aviation, and remote travel.The kit itself comes in a waterproof container. I found it to be a bit tight when closing back up, but there is actually some room for more items. All components are of the highest quality. It's lightweight and I never notice it in a pocket. With the recommended ETS or similar keychain LED flashlight and a good pocket folding knife, you have a complete survival kit that rivals ones costing $100+. These are cheap enough to get one for each car and any camping/hiking/marine/aviation gear you might have. I highly recommend this PSP. I'm not affiliated with ETS, but I've come to appreciate their no-nonsense advice and forums. And if this was a bad kit, I'd still say so.

You might even need it if your resistance to colds is low!Because we live much ""cleaner"" lives than our ancestors did, sterilizing our dishes, putting our food in the fridge, and spraying pesticides on everything, we live our lives virtually bacteria-free.  Free of the GOOD bacteria, that is.  The baddies seem to still get us, and without the good ones to balance them out, we're in trouble.A lack of friendly bacteria in your intestines can cause problems throughout your body.  To put it in ""nice"" terms, it's a little like having backed up plumbing inside you, and the world just ain't gonna be right until you fix it.I started on probiotic therapy several months ago, and I was amazed at the following things that happened almost immediately:*That little stomach paunch WENT AWAY.  I kid you not.  Talk about an instant self-esteem booster.*My chronic [men, cover your ears] yeast infections decreased dramatically (even without my eliminating wheat from my diet, which I know I ought to do).*I had more energy and felt more like the me of years ago.*I became more resistant to colds than I used to be.If you're considering supplementing your diet with probiotics, you should know that not all of them are created equal.  In fact, testing done by www.consumerlab.com indicates that the vast majority of probiotic supplements don't deliver the number of live organisms they claim -- not even close!  Those little creatures are very delicate, and things like processing, shipping, and sitting on your shelf can kill them.  And let's not even talk about what your stomach acid does to them.Primal Defense is one of the few supplements that delivers the amount of probiotics it claims to.  (I can tell from its effects on me.)  In addition, it contains lots of good-for-you green foods that also help build that all-important inner strength.One very important caveat about Primal Defense, though:  Because it's SO effective, don't even think about starting out taking 3 tablets a day!  Not unless you don't mind a lot of abdominal discomfort and are able to spend several days all by yourself at home.  I took one a day for about 2 months, and then I finally felt ready to move up to 2.  It'll be at least another month before I'm up to the recommended 3.One more thing:  Drink lots of water.

A few things to bear in mind:  In consecutive readings done at the same time, you will see a trend from higher to lower blood pressure as you ""learn"" to lower your own pressure.  Also, your blood pressure at home will be lower than that you obtain at your doctor's office until you learn to overcome the anxiety normally associated with the doctor's office.  This is normal and is one of the main reasons to obtain a home blood pressure monitor.  Also, your pressure will fluctuate from day to day and even during a blood pressure monitoring session.  So don't automatically assume that the gauge is not giving accurate readings!  Trust me, it is.This monitor has been extensively tested against measurements obtained at the doctor's office and has been determined to be as accurate a method of determining blood pressure as you would obtain at the doctor's office - actually, more accurate since the anxiety factor is eliminated.  So if you are looking for the best home blood monitor device on the market look no further.  Just made sure and trust it!I heartily endorse this product",5.0,positive

It will never be as close as one of those flashy Gillette blades, though.  I'm one of those guys with a pretty thick, fast growing beard, so this is a concern for me every morning.  I've definitely gone through my share of various types of electrics and razors.Hands down, there is a huge convenience factor added with the self-cleaning.  No mess. No hassles.  Just drop it in the charger, push the button, and let it do its thing for about an hour.From a financial standpoint, its a mixed bag when comparing to standard blades.  Your typical Fusion blade costs between $3-$4, and based on the type of beard you have, a single blade can last about a week, give or take.  So per use, its definitely cheaper to go with electric.  However, with such high up-front costs to purchase the Braun, along with changing the cleaning cleaning fluid each month at around $4/each, it will take a few years to break-even. (In fact, if you want to get really technical, with inflation and interest rates considered, you may never really break-even.  I was actually distorted enough to run these calculations in Excel.)  However, from a purely psychological sense, you don't feel like you're getting robbed each time you have to buy more razors, you just get robbed once.So, in summary, solid electric shaver, cool added value of convenience, and its kind of your call on whether you think you'll be saving money or not",4.0,positive

Think about it: how does a scale ""measure"" your body fat? Good question. So I went to the website of the manufacturer and...surprise, surprise...there were no details about HOW this worked. It did, however, note what it was SUPPOSED to detect and how that might connect to body fat.  The scale supposedly measures something called ""electrical impedence"" which sounds pretty complex but really isn't all that hard to understand. All it means is that the more fat you have in your body, the more ""impedence"" you have and the higher the body fat reading. Electricity doesn't flow as well through fat and the scale is supposed to detect that. BUT HERE IS THE CATCH - getting an ACCURATE body fat measurement can not possibly be done by just stepping on a scale, especially if the consumer (buyer) of that scale doesn't understand the factors that are VITAL to an accurate measurement. What you have in your body when you step ON the scale is one vital factor. Here is just one example of how easy it would be to get a bad reading: If you are dehydrated from not drinking enough water or, conversely, you are OVERhydrated from drinking too much water or you haven't measured your body fat within a certain amount of time AFTER exercise or you've been standing too long or you've eaten recently.....you are very likely to get an inaccurate reading and you'll be confused by the variation in readings from one day to the next, not knowing WHAT factor or combination of factors is affecting your reading. Even worse, you'll have no real idea of your body fat.From what I've seen, these scales do provide accurate weight measurements.But when it comes to measuring body fat,the ads or website do not seem to indicate that you can get an inaccurate reading if you step on the scale at the wrong time of day, too soon after exercising, if you are thirsty, etc.So save your money.  If you are working out regularly, eating right, getting in shape, etc....odds are that your body fat is dropping and you'll see signs of this. You don't need this scale to prove it (although you might consider it worthwhile to discover your actual body fat some other way). Signs of reduced body fat are firmer muscles, looser clothes and (often) a more streamlined figure. Your metabolism is likely to be more efficient, assuming you don't overeat too much. If you absolutely HAVE to know your percentage of body fat, just ask your local physician, trainer or gym director how to get an accurate assesment and when to do so. If you workout regularly at the suggested or peak training level, your body fat should go down, assuming you don't compensate by eating too much. So don't count on this scale to give you the consistency or quality of a detailed and CONTROLLED body fat measurement. It won't.",2.0,negative

Because the Panasonic is more powerful than the Hitachi, and its hard plastic roller head is better suited to a man's, um, contours.  In addition, the Panasonic is quiet and causes no video interference, a selling point in case you augment your ""massage"" sessions with some video stimulation... The only reason I don't give the Panasonic five stars is that previous ""Panabrators"" have proven less than reliable; typically they seem to last about a year before they conk out.

4533,B000GUSE5W:fresh_food_made_easy!:a._mccallum,"This system is the best for making fresh baby food at home!The book uses chapters to show you which foods to introduce at the appropriate ages. The first chapter is first foods, and features easily-digestible foods like acorn squash and pears. As the book progresses with the baby's age, the food variety increases to include things like asparagus and black beans. The final chapters introduce berries and nuts for babies over 12 months. There is no meat in the system, but they do have tofu.The book tells you exactly how many of a fruit or veggie to buy, what to look for in selecting fresh produce, and step-by-step instructions on how to clean, peel, cook and puree the food for your baby. It is an excellent guide, even for the novice shopper/food preparer. It doesn't miss a step!They also make suggestions on which spices can be added to the food while cooking for flavor variety. For instance, they tell you how much cinnamon to add to your cooking apples to get delicious cinnamon applesauce. This makes for delicious taste-tempters like vanilla pears and ginger yams that babies can't resist!To add even more variety to your baby's diet, the book suggests ""medleys"" which are combinations of foods that go well together. Once you have introduced both foods separately, you can create a medley for an interesting variation.Major pros of this system:1 - Save money! Buying fresh produce in season and making your own baby food from it is sooooo much cheaper than buying all of those little jars.2 - Baby is healthier! Commercial jarred baby foods contain fillers that have no nutritional value. They also can contain pesticides and preservatives. I don't want my baby eating any of that!3 - Food tastes better! Have you ever tried jarred baby food? Blech! It doesn't taste anything like the food it's supposed to be! No wonder baby spits it out - I would too. The pureed foods from this system are fresh and tasty, and baby will love them. An excerpt from the front of the book: ""Did you know that baby food could be up to three years old when you buy it on the grocery store shelf?"" Sorry, but I don't want my baby eating anything older than him.I adored this system when my son started eating solid food, and I still use it today to create healthy fresh side dishes for him and the rest of the family.

It only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading magnifiers, and it is possible to adjust it to just about any position with the clever arm.

If the user turned the adjustment knob too far, it and the nut that holds it together would fall off.  The nut is small and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to assemble the device.  The knob actually turns the nut onto the screw. Presumably the device is for someone with low vision.  If the small nut falls to the floor, I'm not sure someone with low vision would be able to find it.

The trickling sound of the water droplets falling back into the water reservoir, the cascading mist spilling over the sides of the fountain and the everchanging lights contribute to a very calming and relaxing atmosphere in whatever room you decide to place the fountain.  It also provides a good way of hydrating the air during the dry winter months without the need of a dedicated humidifier.The only caution I have is to place the fountain on a surface that can withstand moisture.

It shaves pretty well though I find I have to go back over areas a time or two to make sure I get it all the same length. I think it may have to do with the way the guard is and not a fault of the clipper itself. I've had it for maybe a month now and it has kept up well the four or so times I've shaved my head since. The little trimmer that comes with it is pretty nice and powerful for running on AA batteries. It trimmed down my facial hair and cleaned up my neck very fast when my old trimmer took some pressing and a few passes.I only have two minor complaints about the actual product itself. It gets really warm after 10-15 minutes. Normally this might not be a big deal but if you have a big head like I do and have to make sure you get it all done properly it can start to get too hot to want to use. The other thing is that it isn't too great for no guard shaving. Now granted I only tried it once but it wasn't catching everything when I did try. It could be that I was just holding it at the wrong angle to get it, which is easy to do in a mirror, but I thought it was worth noting just incase. I think it may need the guards to guide the hair in better.Also, something kind of odd and nasty, Amazon sent me an open used one. Now for $15 I wasn't going to bother returning it or complaining.

The only areas I have trouble with are by my Adam's apple and under my ear, but I have a big apple and bony jaw and my Mach 3 has a tough time with these areas.

After losing 40lbs and getting in shape, I wanted to become stronger, to add muscle, while not gaining the fat I had worked so hard to lose. I bought this scale to monitor different fitness programs, the key being that I could now distinguish between gains in fat and gains in lean mass--muscle. For almost I year I exercised at least 5 times a week, much of it weightlifting, but also running, swimming, soccer and many other activities. During that time I kept track of everything I ate. Sometimes I would keep a positive energy balance, to gain muscle while not gaining or minimizing fat, other times I would have a negative energy balance to lose fat while not losing or minimizing muscle gain. The Nutrition portion of my plan I got from the excellent book Power Eating by Susan M. Kleiner.It's been roughly a year, and I feel great. When I play soccer I feel as swift as a bird and as strong as a snake. I can lift considerably more weight then a year a go. And when I look in the mirror, I not only look bigger, but more defined. I believe I have gained a considerable amount of muscle, perhaps 5 pounds, and lost an equal amount of fat.I say I believe because according to the scale I am exactly where I was a year ago. When I was gaining weight, the scale always said it was roughly 50/50, and when I lost weight it was roughly the same. I was feeling pretty defeated until I stumbled across some photos of my self from a year ago. The difference is striking and obvious. I can only conclude that the scale consistently overestimated fat gain, and underestimated muscle gain. I know the scale accurately measures my weight because I have checked it against other scales. However, in terms of measuring changes in body composition, the reason I bought the scale, it is total failure.I defense of Weight Watchers, they didn't design the scale with this kind of use in mind. But it seems to me that people just trying to lose weight will be served by a normal scale while those targeting fat but not muscle, would be given bad information from this scale. I am now looking for a new scale, one the claims to monitor changes in muscle mass, but I will much more skeptical of my next scale. I would be very interested in other people experiences, since I am now in the position of not being able to assess fitness program that I have spent a great deal of effort on.

The problem only got worse. Returned 3 weeks later.I just got the Panasonic and can say that it definitely shaves closer than both of the tried razors. They shave MUCH faster than the Braun and Norelcos.I'm not sure if I like the ""side to side"" pivoting head, only time will tell. The heads don't pivot up and down as much as the Braun, but once again, time will tell if this is necessary.One MAJOR advantage is that it cleans with soap and water... No expensive refills to hassle over.The panasonic has two noticeable downsides:1. It's louder than other shavers, but who cares? It shaves incredibly fast anyway.2. You can't plug it in and shave...

I not only shave every day now with my Braun, but I can also shave again in the evening if I have a date.The charge is right about what others have mentioned.  You can get a good 40 to 50 minutes of shave time with it.It shaves very close.

Again, it's a very close shave.  At least as good if not better than my Mach 3.Also, like other reviews, I'm still trying to figure out what Braun was thinking when they designed that travel case.  Where am I supposed to put my electric cord?  The poor design of the travel case is my only complaint about this shaver.It's very easy to clean.  Don't spend extra money for a shaver with cleaning solution that you have to purchase again and again.  With a little practice, I've reduced the time required to clean my razor to under a minute.

However, I am a natural skeptic... I guess I believed these products were just out there to prey on vulnerable smokers who are self-conscious from all us non-smokers picking on them.As a non-smoker who nevertheless loves dark-coloured drinks (coke, root beer, tea, coffee), I've never used any kind of whitening product, except toothpastes which didn't work.From the Crest Whitestrips commercials, I thought the strips would be something almost invisible that you could wear while at work, on the subway or wherever.  Not quite!  For what it's worth, they sort of look and feel like bandaids on your teeth; slippery bandaids that wiggle around if you try to do anything more stressful than write Amazon reviews.  :-)BUT let's put this into perspective:  you use them twice a day (1/2 hr each time) for ten days and you're DONE for a good long while (how long depends on your personal eating/drinking/smoking habits).  You can even use one strip for 1/2 an hour, then start your second strip right away afterwards... to get it all over with even faster. The first evening I tried Whitestrips Renewal, I put them in to watch TV, and I don't think I had them in quite right because they kept slipping around.  Also, I didn't rinse my fingers and the peroxide made my fingertips turn white and sting.  However, a quick rinse took care of that.  DO NOT get this stuff in your eyes, on your clothing or any other delicate surface.  It's powerful stuff!Anyway, I was cursing the strips until I realized that I would just have to not speak for half an hour while I had them in.  Maybe other people can manage it, but talking doesn't work for me with the strips in.  Since then, it's been a breeze each time.SO... I guess the caveats are that you should set aside time to do this, during TV-watching or web-surfing downtime (as a bonus, you may lose weight from not snacking for that half-hour!), and not expect to be out doing errands with the strips on like the people in commercials seem to be able to do.Anyway, if you want to turn back the clock by a few years and turn up the compliments, the Whitestrips Renewal system seems like a great way to go - at a fraction of the cost of professional dental whitening",4.0,positive

I have been using this specific model for more than 3 months now and I am really satisfied with it. It is really accurate (&lt;1% declination, I have performed more than four tests of more than 400 steps during different times of its life and I have seen a couple of cheap pedometers performing much worse), clips firmly to belt or pants, displays the time conveniently and has nice backlight, even has a radio which works, although as most people said, not really its best feature. The truth is that I am not using the radio at all, mostly because I believe the batteries will last longer and it will save me from extra trips to Walmart. But I have tested it and it works, although nothing impressive there. Of course, for the money, I think you cannot go wrong with this pedometer.One funny comment is that, although most people complain it cannot open very easily, after sometime it will open more easily that you think. Actually it has been a couple of times where putting a bag on my shoulders or a waist pouch and applying some pressure on it by mistake, will open it wide, so it does not count any steps. But it does not open by itself anyway, needs external force for this to happen, so it does not happen often.All in all, I am sure that the plastic construction and the less than rigorous production testing will result in many pieces that do not function properly and will result in bad reviews.

Both surgeries have left me non-weight bearing for 6 weeks and at least 12 weeks on crutches.  I'm an avid exerciser, but by no means am I in shape.  I purchased this for my second surgery.  I'd already experienced trying to precariously balance on one foot in the shower after my first surgery and I didn't want to do that again.Ther bench is comfortable with a curved grey seat.  It has holes for drainage.  The legs feel sturdy and are adjustable.  I don't feel like I'm going to tip over in the shower even though I've moved it to the tallest position to aid me in standing.   The seat has two handles formed on the narrow edges and sturdy rubber feet to keep it from slipping.  It is lightweight and easy to move.  You need to put it together.  I seemed to need another washer to attach the seat to the legs, but other than that it was really quick.  You will need a phillips head screwdriver.  The shipping was free.  The price was low.  The quality is excellent.  The seat is comfortable.  It's very stable.  It's durable.  What more could I ask for?After my first surgery, I got around on crutches and used a bag taped on my leg with waterproof tape to keep the cast dry.  This time I've planned much better.  I'm using:  XeroSox Pro-Pump to keep the cast dry - It's wonderful, heavy duty.  No tape or mess.  You can easily pump the air out and submerge.  The pressure of pumping the air out on my ankle is painful so I can't pump the air out. The opening is tight enough that I can pull it high on my thigh and still remain perfectly dry in the shower.  It has a skid proof durable sole.    Crutch Mate Arm Pads - Pretty easy to put on.  I could feel the front and back edges under my arms so I put it over the exsisting pads.  Very nice.     Walker - My husband got this for me because he knew how hard it was for me to hop on one foot on crutches while on morphin.  I was reluctant, but it's wonderful.  The stability is worth it, especially getting in and out of the shower.       Roll-a-bout - I haven't used this much because I'm still housebound, but I've met a few people who love it.  Its so much easier than crutches.     Office chair on wheels - This is my life saver.  We leave one in the kitchen and I scoot wherever I need to go.  It offers easy mobility and comfort.  A wheelchair wouldn't easily fit in my small home so this has been great.           I Want That Body - exercise, weight lifting dvd.

This lamp does *not* offer the correct level of light intensity specified by the National Institute of Mental Health for the treatment of Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.). The product literature packed with the lamp has no mention at all that this product offers ""mood-brightening"" light. Because of this glaring misrepresentation, I am currently debating whether to the return the lamp.I agree with the other reviewer that the adhesive labels (there are two) are VERY sticky and difficult to remove completely. I used a combination of methods to remove the adhesive residue. And I agree with the comments about the company name being printed on the front of the lamp.

My entire life, I have had naturally curly, flyaway hair that was annoyingly prone to frizzing and just generally difficult to manage.   I wasn't sure if it was this dryer that had finally started smoothing out my hair, or if it was rather the newer conditioners and styling cremes I had found.When the ionic brush dryer I was using recently 'died', I was unable to find a replacement in any local stores.  So, instead, I bought one that looked exactly the same that wasn't ionic, thinking it really wouldn't make any difference.  Boy, was I wrong!!!  Immediately, I was again dealing with split ends, frizzies, and flyaway hair.There HAS to be something to 'ionic' hairdryers that really DOES make a difference, as I changed nothing else.  Being the scientific person that I am, I repeated this unplanned 'experiment' at least 3 times.  When I use this product, my hair is noticeably silkier, shinier, and bouncier...with healthy waves that hold (I have somewhat thick hair.)  The round brush/dryer style also dries my hair much quicker than the way I used to do it for years (with round brushes and typical pistol-style dryers), and with much less arm-fatigue.   The heated air dries it from the 'inside out' which styles it at the same time, eliminating my previous need for the use of a curling iron or hot rollers to create soft waves/curls after drying.I plan to keep a spare one hand for the next time one dies on me suddenly.

I think this is a painful way to remove hair, but let's remember that You will be removing many hairs by the root! I have tried Nair, and waxing. So I can say that I know what pain is. But at least with this pain you should get weeks of smooth skin. I have only just used it so I don't know how long I will get or how many ingrown hairs I will get.     I used this on my back and arms and and just tried a little on my face. They say not to use on your face, why I don't know other than the pain. I bleed in a few spots and would break out into cold sweats while using this. Anyone that has used any electric shaver should know that they always say that your skin just needs time to get use to it. So I am hoping and thinking this will be the case with this.     Even with what I have said above I would recommend this product Because it does it's job, and I am so thankful for being able to have found this product. I think in the long run it will be worth it. Because it is a lot cheaper than anything else. Even if it breaks and I have to buy one every year. Since I was spending around $50 a month when I was paying for Nair, a growth inhibitor and shipping. which is 50 X 12 = 600 yr.Also when it comes to time it may take awhile to do the area(s) that you chose but in the long run it really is no time at all. Remember you should get a least a couple of days or up to 6 weeks of being smooth.     For my back I used Nair since I did not have this product yet. Then waited a week for the skin to heal.This helped me not have as long or as many hairs to pull. They recommend trimming the hairs if it's been awhile since your last session. but since I couldn't reach I had to use the Nair.

I myself prefer cloth diapers, but because we have a high water table if we do much laundry our septic backs up into our house - yuck! I am also severely chemically sensitive and so the scent on ""normal"" diapers and even the Seventh Generations ones that have gel make me ill. But these are great!! They are made of wood pulp/paper and do feel as if there were cotton in them. They have no chemical scent at all and feel nice and soft and smooth to my fingers. They close by means of an adhesive strip on either side that closes onto a larger piece of thin plastic on either side. If you accidentally close the adhesive strip on the paper it will tear when you pull it back off and usually not reseal. This is not a problem if you use them only once. We potty our baby and so sometimes we take it off and put it back on a few times before it gets wet or dirty. Other than accidentally sticking the strips to the paper I haven't had another problem with using them like this. There is elastic at the legs but it is basically encased so that it isn't in contact with the skin and they are snug enough on my baby's legs. These are a little harder to tell if they are wet than the seventh generation ones (I've never used regular diapers since I can't get near them with their chemical scent) because there isn't a gel. I usually just put a finger on it and then touch that finger to my thumb and then I can tell if I feel dampness or not. If my baby pees a lot though it is easy to tell if it is wet...even from the outside because it will look a little more molded in form, but does not feel damp on the outside and the inside is less damp even then than in a cloth diaper.The packaging says that you should not let the baby put these in his/her mouth since it is paper and can tear off in their mouth and that it should not be held near a flame - again because it is made out of paper. But all that said, these are not flimsy at all, they are well made and hold up just as well as a regular disposable. I highly recommend these for anyone who for whom cloth diapers just isn't possible or for those times when impractical (day care) for those people who want to limit their baby's exposures to chemicals",5.0,positive

Second, this only works on NEW pimples so when you get it, don't expect the ones you currently have to suddenly disappear.  It works best when you first notice a pimple appearing, especially in that just starting to get sore, slight red spot stage.That being sad, it does actually work, provided you keep the first two rules in mind!  Two days after I received mine, I noticed that tell tale red spot beginning to form, I zapped it & not only did it not get worse, by the next morning, it was completely gone!Plus, a portion of the pink version goes to Breast Cancer research & if you buy it from the company (not sure about Amazon) there is a 30-Day Money Back Guarantee.All in all, a great product",4.0,positive

4984,B000A23CQM:solid_shaver:surrational,"this shaver performs extremely well. shaves as close as a razor, and a full charge lasts an entire month, longer if you dont shave every day. the instructions are absolutely correct, it takes a few weeks to get used to it, so dont be too put off if your first couple shaves are uncomfortable. if you have more sensitive skin, i would stongly recommend using minimal pressure at first, even if that means not getting the closest shave. once your skin adjusts, you can still get shaver burn if you press too hard, especially on the neck, so resist any urge to grind the shaver into your beard.despite providing an incredibly close shave, it sometimes fails to grab every hair on the first couple passes and its a little tricky maneuvering around a strong adams apple. after taking those shortcomings into account, its still superior in every way to the other shavers ive used: a top model braun foil shaver, and a couple cheaper norelco models. while that doesnt qualify me as an authority on shavers, i can appreciate when a product basically lives up to expectations. even though the 9160 isnt quite perfect, it comes through with a reasonably fast, close and comfortable shave. here are a few tips that should help, especially when starting out:1) shave BEFORE you shower. the shaver works better with a stiffer beard and your face will be less sensitive.2) shave every day if you can.  the longer your beard, the more hair gets missed.3) if any hairs do get missed after a couple passes, leave them. its not worth getting every hair in exchange for shaver burn. as you get more experienced with the shaver, youll get better at using it. touch up rogue whiskers with the sideburn trimmer.4) this shaver has trouble with longer hairs that lie flat.  if you spot any after your first pass, use the sideburn trimmer to shorten them before touching up with the rotary blades. if youve already made a couple passes before you notice them, refer back to tip #3.5) keep the tension setting on normal.  if you set it to sensitive, you just have to press harder and make more passes to get a good shave.6) if you still have trouble with shaver burn, use a little apple cider vinegar as an aftershave. yes, it will feel like your face is being ripped off for a couple seconds. if youre not a fan of that sensation, you may dilute it. let it dry completely, then rinse it off. its the best solution ive tried for minimizing razor bumps, and ive tried them all",4.0,positive

4991,B000F63TW0:an_esthetician's_word__of_caution:r._najda,"As an esthetician I would advise against using these sort of products. They basically sand your face off. Please leave microderm and abrasive exfoliation to trained and licensed professionals. I can assure you that I am not just saying this to drum up business. I would much rather have people not do anything to their skin than to use a product like this. You initially see great results because of the aggressiveness of the exfoliation, but believe me, you will pay for it in the long run. The main ingredient in this product is aluminum oxide (also referred to as corundum), which is characteristically known for its hardness, and is typically used as an industrial abrasive in sandpaper and as a component in cutting tools. This material is rated as 9 out of 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, making it second only to diamonds in abrasiveness. You may argue that this is also the same substance use in clinical microdermabrasion procedures, but you need to realize that these procedures can only be preformed by a board certified plastic surgeon, dermatologist, or licensed esthetician trained in microdermabrasion treatment. I see people coming in every day who use these at home kits and products, and they all have the same issue; It worked great at first, then after some time they started to notice that it wasn't working as effectively, so they used it more often and harder.Exfoliation of the skin increases cell turnover and helps prepare the skin for hydration and moisturization when done right. When this process is done more often than necessary, or in an overly aggressive manner, you can end up damaging your skin and causing permanent scar tissue build up and inflammation. People don't seem to realize that there is oil on our face for a reason, it's there to protect and moisturize our skin. When you constantly cleanse and exfoliate your skin, you are doing more harm than good. Over stripping the skin causes irritation, break-outs, and heightened sensitivity that rarely can be reversed. When your skin is constantly bombarded by aggressive exfoliation, it's defense is to build up thicker layers of skin for protection. So please, if you do use this, use extreme caution, don't use it on your face, and do not use it more than once a week, if that. Ask any esthetician, plastic surgeon, or dermatologist out there and they'll tell you the same thing: there is a reason people don't get facials, chemical peels, and microderm every day, or even more once a month. The adage ""too much of a good thing"" stands true here.if you need more convincing, please refer to the following links and make the decision your self.[...",1.0,negative

In the past several weeks, I have heard a few different Psychiatrists I work with, people I respect, tell me they have patients who take Omega-3 fatty acid supplements and believe that it helps with mood stabilization.  (This, in addition to the other well publicized below-the-neck benefits.) So, take it for what it's worth.  It's a relatively benign supplement, I've heard people worry about mercury but it should be filtered out of any quality supplements.  If it helps, great.  If it doesn't help, no harm done.  Probably.  Again, I'm not talking about double-blind controlled studies, just cocktail party quality anecdotes.  Even so, I thought you'd want me to share.  They always say it is better to get your nutrition from foods as opposed to supplements, but if you eat enough fish to get the same equivalent of omega-3 fatty acids, you will be consuming some mercury.  I'm not a toxicologist, I don't know how big of a deal that is or isn't.Having given my off-the-record opinion, I'll now give my expert opinion:  Talk to your doctor about any supplements or herbal medications you are interested in taking.And, please, talk to your doctor if you feel you need a mood stabilizer and this hasn't been professionally evaluated. If your doctor is in too much of a hurry, or too dismissive, time for a new doctor",5.0,positive

Three years ago, I tried again with a Remington, and it worked great for my head -- not so great for my face.  Lots of nicks, and spread a rash. I was especially disappointed that it didn't get my neck very well. Both shavers were straight foil shavers, as I thought they would shave closer than round heads.Then, I purchased this Norelco over 2 months ago, and it has worked like a dream for me.  While the first week wasn't especially close, it was convenient as I was traveling for work.  By the third week, however, the shave was CLOSER than my regular Mach 3 blade shave! One huge difference: I bought some Letric Shave pre-shave liquid, which makes the whiskers stand up, and also disinfects the shaving heads. I haven't had one cut, and no rash, in over 60 shaves with this unit.  Since then, I have used the Norelco every morning, along with the Letric Shave, and have been thrilled with the results.  I have also wondered whether my previous experience with an electric would have been better had I $3.49 to get the pre-shave splash!I have to agree with one poster who complained about the plastic parts - the only reason I didn't give the product 5 stars.

5247,B00081NEUE:one_little_problem:m._allen_greenbaum,"I gotta admit--the concept is great.AS you drive, you sit on a nicely cushioned seat cover that also:1. Massages your upper back, lower back, or both,2. Has an optional heating unit for comfort and warmth, and3. Plugs into your auto's cigarette lighter.The massage is conducted though 5 vibrating balls located inside the cushion, and therein, literally, lies the problem.  The ball located in the center of the upper part of the cushion digs--annoying, uncomfortably, and very noticeably--into your back, rendering the whole massage/comfort angle a moot point.  As well as the rest of this works, and it does (the heat is perceptible, the other four balls feel fine, the cushion fits snugly around your seat with a velcro-closed belt), that one protruding ball makes this an uncomfortable experience.  I'm taking mine back.On the positive side, the company is just one ""point"" away from a very good product.  If you see this (or something like it), try to ""test drive"" it at the store.  Maybe this company (or others) place the balls in a better position in other products.  A few other notes:  You cannot turn the heat on independent of the massage; that is, if the massager is not on, you cannot turn the heater on. Also, this is not shiatsu-like massage, not at this price. You're getting an electricity-generated vibration here, at two speeds, low and high.  At the high speed, you feel more stimulated than relaxed, as if somehow one of those old vibrating foorball game surfaces were up against your back. In fact, the brief manual accompanying the BK-2500 cautions people against using this at night, as it may keep you awake for a little while.

Convert it from Demo Mode per the included instructions, and it's ready to use.  The padding is excellent, the display very readable, and the color coding is invaluable.  Also, the shower diverter remains functional, unlike virtually every other spout cover.First test of the thermometer, and we watched it go from blue to green to red, for cold to warm to hot, and all coincided with what we 'thought' we had accurately felt previously.  However, we discovered that we had likely flirted with hot on more than one occasion as we settled on the temperature that we normally felt was right for our daughter.  Yikes!

We notified 911, and he was taken for medical care without any problems, but I was a bit worried there for a few minutes.  While I'm trained in BLS, that is, at best, a temporizing measure.

5313,"B000052YAQ:a_dentist_reviews_this_product:james_koenig_""konedog4""","As any dental health professional will attest to, flossing one's teeth is just as important as brushing, and perhaps more so, for the bacteria that causes gum disease (and to a certain extent cavities) almost always starts between the teeth. Daily flossing breaks up the film of harmful bacteria and allows it to be removed.  Therefore, as a dentist, I am always stressing the importance of daily flosing to my patients.  My advice is this:1.  Choose a floss that is comfortable to you and is the right thickness for your teeth.  Some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping the floss around the fingers, while others prefer thin flavored floss to waxed thick floss. There are so many options - choose the right one for you.  2.  Waxed floss is ""waxed"" to allow easier passage between the teeth.  Waxed floss is no more effective than unwaxed at removing the bacterial film build-up. The important thing is to floss!3.  Floss once daily, preferably before brushing.  Flossing breaks up the film of bacteria between the teeth in areas a toothbrush cannot reach.  It is important to then brush the teeth and rinse between the teeth to remove the film of bacteria that the flossing has dislodged.  Without brushing or rinsing after flossing, the bacteria can reattach to the teeth.  4.  Try to tie in flossing with another habit, such as watching the 10 PM news.  I know it sounds strange, but incorporating flossing into another habit leads one into developing a new habit.  Some complain that they don't have time to floss; well, if flossing is tied into another habit, such as watching TV, both can easily be done concurrently.  5.  There are many gimmicks the manufacturers use to sell their particular brand of floss.  Some flavor the floss, some incorporate fluoride into the strands of floss, and some make their floss more slippery for folks with tight contacts.  Whatever the case, the most important point is to choose a floss variety you will use regularly.  It is the mechanical act of removing the bacterial flim that is the important part, not the flavoring or chemical additions to the floss.  6.  If you want to keep your teeth for a life-time, develop the flossing habit.  As one wise sage said: ""If you ignore your teeth, they will eventually go away"".  I recommend this product because it is effective and is relatively easy to use.  I have found that it tends to shred more than regular floss, and this bothers me a bit so I do not use it regularly.  I like the mint flavor and the fluoride cannot hurt either.  All in all, it is a good product.  Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig, DDS",4.0,positive

In the past, I preferred the Remington because it is powerful and fast.  But the Remington irritates my skin.  The Braun is less powerful and less irritating, but still irritating.  I had previously used the Norelco Rotary, perhaps 15 years ago, but it was too slow and not close enough.  However, although most shavers remain pretty much the same over the years, this Norelco is a giant step improved above prior models.  It shaves faster, and is much easier to clean.  The old Norelco was difficult to clean.  This shaver can be cleaned very well just with hot water.  However, I use soap as the lubricant.  (If you use oily stuff, marketed as various pre-shaves, which basically puts a film of oil on your face, there will be a tendency for the gunk to accumulate under the blades.  I recommend just using ordinary soap.)  This new model of Norelco has larger blades, and better shape, allowing for a closer and faster shave.  Also, it is much quieter than the back and forth models.  Think of the inefficiency of ramming the blades of an ordinary shaver back and forth.  The rotary energy here more efficiently and quietly goes to shaving the beard.  As I have aged, my beard has become less dense.  If you have a tough beard, and a thick beard, you may prefer an alternative.  However, if you want a close shave, from a quiet mechanism, which is relatively easy to clean, I recommend this Norelco.  You may not need the well designed cleaning bay, and may prefer just the shaver and charger.  I hardly use the cleaning system because just hot water works so well, using soap as a lubricant.  Interesting, the brochure recommends just a clean, dry face.  I have found that soap works better.  Anyway, I would recommend this shaver as one of the best available.

I bought the Remmington #1080N wax core roller set and I have finally found the easiest and quickest  way to curl my hair.  The rollers surface, when warm, grab the hair ends immediately to allow great control when trying to roll even short hair.  The rollers are held in place by a full clip which looks more like a comb so the clips do not leave a ridge in my hair.  Once heated, the rollers are relatively cool to the touch (no more burned fingers) but due to the wax core, the rollers hold plenty of     heat and it takes just a few minutes after setting to produce excellent, long lasting results.  The set takes about 10 - 15 minutes to warm up.  I've found the warm up time takes longer than the time I actually leave the curlers in my hair.  This is the Best curler set I have EVER used.  If I was to ask for one change, it would be a quicker warm up time.  However, just the fact that rolling is so quick and easy, makes up for the few extra minutes of preparation.  I'm hard to please, so my recommendation says alot.  Thanks Remmington (I still don't like your other regular rollers! Ha)",5.0,positive

I am stationed overseas and decided to cough up the $40 vs. $8 haircuts once a week. It more than paid for itself in no time. I give myself a simple haircut once a week (just one length throughout). Some of the user comments on Amazon did not affect me and I felt compelled to tell about it:1. Binding. Just keep your hair short and trim often and it won't bind. What else can you expect from a cordless trimmer. They do not put out power compared to a corded electric one. Even with the trimmer plugged in, it still will bind. I found this out the very first time I used it. My hair was about 1 1/2 inches long. Yes, it did bind (the first time). After keeping my hair at setting 8 (roughly 1/4 inch), it does not bind anymore.2. Setting dial gets accidently turned. I never had a problem. Besides, the way I hold the shaver my thumb is permanently planted on the dial anyway so it will prevent it from turning. The other reviewers who had this problem may have been holding it the wrong way. It does require a little finesse, but you'll get the hang of it by the second or third time.3. Ease of cleaning. The description does not lie when it says submersible. Easy to clean removable blades. Water does not affect this trimmer at all. Very good water-proof design by Panasonic.4. Comes with a little oil bottle and small brush. I clean the thing every single time I use it so it's ready to go the next time. Just oil the blades after every use (Panasonic recommended oiling before and after). I found too much oil will make it harder to clean because the hair sticks more and water can't simply wash it out.3. Overall this trimmer is good to go.

5426,B0009DT342:better_shave_than_a_razor_(but_i_suggest_getting_the_cleaning_base_too):m._landi,"I have to say that I have been converted. For over 15 years now I lived with a razor. I have a pretty thick beard and it grows fast too. I am the kind of guy that gets a 5 o'clock shadow at noon. I have used every single type of razor out there from disposable to the battery operated vibrating type and from the one blade to the 5+1 blade. I have tried all the brands and ended up feeling the Gillette brand is the best type of razor, but now I find it's not the best shave. I used an electric shaver several years back, it was one of the top of the line Norelco with the incorporated gel. It gave me a pretty bad razor burn and did not get all the hairs; I ended up having to shave as normal. --TRUE STORY-- I am a Manager at my job and on my last annual review the only item I was marked bad was my personal appearance. Not that I dress bad or not wear deodorant, but that they felt I didn't shave often. (I shave at the very least every other day, usually every day). So I felt I had to so something about it. I researched electric shavers thinking I could get a quick shave during my lunch hour in my car or at least on my way to work so it would last longer. I found that Panasonic seems to be leading the pack and was moderately priced and had all the features the expensive models had. The instruction manual is explicit in saying it will take about 30 days to get used to any new shaving method and they assure you will love the Panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used to the way it is cut. I have been using it for almost 30 days now, and I will not live without it. I have NEVER had this close of a shave before. I can actually go 2 days without getting a shadow. My fiancé has found a new love for touching my face, and I seem to be getting more kisses too! During the first 2 weeks I had to get a couple of the missed hairs with my old Gillette, but today officially I was able to through my Gillette away for good. (My boss has even asked what I am doing different and when I told him, he went out and bought one too, he also loves it now. My fiancé said she would leave me if I stopped using the Panasonic, it's a good thing Panasonic has been around for decades) So, I am raving about his product, but every good has its bad... what the bad? Well, it gets a couple of weeks to get used to the shave, but for the amount of time I am planning to use it and the money I am saving from buying razors every month, I can handle that. The cleaning system is very good, but it takes very long to clean (2-3 hrs) and it is noisy since the base turns the shaver on and off during the cleaning cycles. The cleaning cartage is said to last 3 months whether you use it once a day or one a week. I have not gotten to that point yet, but it is very very easy to clean in the shower with some body wash. I just end up using the base for the drying cycle, which is an option. The batter is very good. In the month I have used it, I have charged it twice but it really didn't need it as it said the charge was good. Overall... excellent product. Could there be a better shaver out there, maybe, will I ever know... at this time, I am not worried about it, I am very satisfied with this Panasonic, and don't think it can get any better. This product does not include the cleaning base. I do recommend it as even if you don't use it to clean the razor, you can use it to dry it, it will help keep your blades in the newest condition and prevent them from rusting when air drying. But, if you are looking to save money and get an excellent razor, this is it!",5.0,positive

I have been on statins of various types for over 10 years. As time has passed, I began to suffer from fatigue, stiffness and muscle pains. A recent blood test showwed that my CPK levels were slightly elevated, but not so much so that I should be alarmed. I began to research C-Q10 in regards to statins on the web and discovered a lot of information describing how statins reduce natural levels of C-Q10 in the body which leads to all of the above problems. If it is not addressed it will eventually damage the heart. Suprisingly, I found that Mercke had actaully been awarded 2 pattents on statins with C-Q10 included in the medication specificall becuase of the known problems with statins. Why they have never manufactured this combinations is a puzzle, but I have concluded on my own that it is to keep that ""bad news"" about statuns under wraps; who knows??? Here's what happens. All cells have mitocondria to provide the cells and muscles with energy. Statins zap the process that happens in the mitocondria by inhibiting the production of C-Q10 on the body. Without C-Q10, the mitocondria can not do their job efficiently and then the muscles begin to suffer because of this. Your heart is nothing more than 1 big muscle and it will suffer along with eveything else. Within 24 hours of taking C-Q10 my symptoms had virtually diappeared. After 2 weeks I fell 10 years younger as all of my strength and agility has returned. Great stuff! Do your homework on statins and then decide for yourself if this is right for you. Personally, I will not go 1 more day without taking this. i am at 150 mg per day and that seems to be just right.",5.0,positive

The unfortunate result of such neglect is cavities (especially in kids), and inevitable gum disease in adults, which in both cass over time leads to tooth loss. Gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities from between the teeth is with floss. Mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key, and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline. The bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime. Glide dental floss is probably the best dental floss on the market for ease of use.  It is designed to pass through the contacts of teeth easily without shredding - and it does exactly this.  This is a top-rate product.

I was a bit skeptical at first because of mixed reviews and overwhelmed by the number of different brands claiming to be the only ""true pure brand."" I went with DEX-L10 because I didn't want one that was too weak or too strong at first. The first time I tried it was during mid-afternoon and had no desire to eat for the rest of the evening. The 500mgs seemed to work fine for me but I have a small frame and am at a normal weight, and if I feel I need it stronger I can always take two. I can understand that if you're overweight it might take a much higher dose to get the same effects. From what I've read, some people need 1000 mgs 3 times a day and others could get by on 400mg and still lose weight. I think this is a good brand because there are no other ingredients so you can get the full effect and figure out how much works right for you. The effects are kinda subtle. I can still eat food while taking it but I am not constantly thinking about food every five minutes like I used to do. I also try to eat very healthy and exercise to begin with, and that is the most important thing, so I would only recommend hoodia to someone who needs the extra push to stop eating obsessively. It is not a ""weight loss"" pill per se, but one could lose weight on it realistically. It is only an appetite supressant which is why too many people are disappointed when they don't lose weight. Emotional eaters are known to eat even when they are not hungry. It works, but don't expect it to be a magic cure for everyone.",4.0,positive

5552,B000EX699O:love_my_epilator!:m._smith,"I bought an epilator because I was tired of shaving my legs and waxing was just too expensive for me.  I've had my epilator for several weeks now and I am already seeing amazing results!  I used it for the first time on my legs.  I'm not going to lie...It was painful.  I just made sure to go slowly, pausing every few inches, and making sure my skin was pulled as tightly as I could get it.  Eventually, I was able to get most of the thick, dark hairs off of my legs.  **Please know that the Epilator is not an immediate ""cure-all"".  Hair grows in stages, so as soon as you get rid of some hairs, several more grow in behind them.  (Eventually you can probably get rid of most to all of them, but it will take some time.)  Because of this, it is good to try epilating a couple of times a week.  Since it's winter, I just let it all grow out so that the Epilator can get more hairs.  However, when new hair grows in, I am finding that they are thinner and blonde instead of dark brown.  It doesn't hurt nearly as much to pull those out!  I also know that I'll be able to do this in the spring and summer because the hair is lighter.  My legs are smoother and I don't get razor burn!  Right after epilating, sometimes I do experience a little irritation but, unlike razor burn, it goes away after just a short time.    Another neat thing is that, unlike waxing, the Epilator can grab the teeny tiny almost invisible hairs.  This gives your skin a smoother feel and it gets hairs at the beginning stages of growth!  I used to have to wait two weeks or so for my hair to grow long enough to be waxed.  Now, I get smoother skin just about whenever I want to!    I was a little nervous at first about spending money on a product I had not heard much about.  With the exception of the few reviews I read online, I was pretty much in the dark.  I went ahead and went for it, then realized that this thing paid for itself in about two weeks!  Not only have I epilated my legs, I have also used it under my arms, on my upper lip, and on my bikini line.  The results have been better than I could have imagined!!  Again, I'm not going to lie...OUCH!!!!!  Epilating under my arms hurt initially and they were sore for a few days (I have very thick hairs).  However, I got the majority of the hairs and after the first time, I realized that I'm never going to have to shave again!  Yes, some little blonde hairs grow back, but they are ALL thinner and much less painful.  In fact, sometimes it tickles a little.  :o)  I epilate there once to twice a week (about a five minute job if you're being careful, two if you're in a hurry) and I have smoother underarms!  I used to get my upper lip waxed about once a month.  Now I just epilate.  It hurts, but just for a second.  Plus, I keep up with it so instead of 50 hairs being pulled at once with hot wax, I only need to pull 5-10 each time.    **A word of caution: Our skin is more sensitive in some areas, so if you choose to epilate around the bikini line, be careful.  I managed to give myself a burn from going too slowly with the rotating ""blade"".  Now I just make sure that I don't leave it in one place for more than a couple of seconds.  If I miss some hairs, I come back another time to get them.This epilator comes with a little loufa pad to help reduce ingrown hairs (I've only had a few and the pad fixes them) and a little cleaning brush.  The epilator is very easy to clean.  The top (dark purple section) pops off and you run it under hot water.  When it dries, you put it back on.  **Note, the epilator does not store hairs inside of it.  When they are pulled out, they tend to either gather on the front of the epilator (I stop periodically to wipe them off) or they go flying.  I sit on a towel when epilating to catch most of the hairs.  I hope this review was helpful to you with your decision about buying an epilator.  I am very satisfied with this product and I recommend it to anyone who has at least a little pain tolerance and really wants to get rid of hair stop having to shave all the time.  **Are the few minutes of pain worth it???  ABSOLUTELY!  :o)",5.0,positive

The taste is horrid, and now that I think about the taste again, it is making me gag.  So I bought 3 2-packs of this Chaser 5-hour Energy drink from Walgreen's today at $4.99 per package.  I am a very low energy person, and I probably have some serious medical problem because I sleep 10+ hours a day.  Setting that aside, I am a college student and wait until the last minute to do all of my assignments.  I needed an extra boost to get my homework done so I gulped down one of these 2-oz drinks.  It was a bit difficult because of the taste, but I just chugged the bottle.  In about five minutes, I felt a little burst of energy and my mental alertness increased.  It seemed to wear off after an hour though, and I was back to my tired state.  I am taking a trip to Chicago in a few weeks, and I will probably drink two of these just to get through a day of sight-seeing.  It didn't really do a whole lot for me, but I don't know if it's because I already take a ton of vitamin supplements.  I think I will have to go through a second trial to see if it will work better.  I can't really compare it to any other energy drink because this was my first time experimenting with an energy drink.

5708,"B00012NCHK:flaxseed_oil_is_an_essential_oil_for_life:james_koenig_""konedog4""","Flax is a plant. The seeds in the flax plant are filled with flaxseed oil, (sometimes called linseed oil). The seeds contain fatty oils called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid. ALA is the omega-3 oil in flaxseed. Flaxseed contains both omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids. Flaxseed is nature's richest storehouse of omega-3 fatty acids, and contains more than twice as much omega-3 oil as fish oils, and it costs less , ounce for ounce. Flax also contains other important substances like lignans, which may protect against some types of cancer. The husks of the seeds are rich in mucilage. Both the seed oil and mucilage have many nutritional and therapeutic properties. There are many potential benefits from taking Flax seed oil:Flaxseed Oil lowers cholesterol levels, thereby improving cardiovascular health and lessening the risk of arteriosclerosis. Flaxseed also contains plant nutrients like phytoestrogens. These are natural estrogen-like substances that can lessen the discomfort of menopause.Flaxseed oil may lower high blood pressure.Flaxseed oil helps some people improve their psoriasis and eczema, as it has anti-inflammatory properties. Flaxseed may also reduce the itching, swelling, and redness associated with certain skin disorders such as acne.Flaxseed oil has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis due to its ability to calm inflammation. Flaxseed reduces LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (the body's ""bad cholesterol"") and lowers triglyceride levels. Research shows that flaxseed oil gives much better protection against heart attacks than canola oil or olive oil. Taking flaxseed may reduce cancer risk. This is because flaxseed contains the richest sources of lignan building blocks, which play a major role in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer. New research indicates that the lignans in flaxseed have both short-term and long-term protective effects against colon cancer. Nature Made Flaxseed Oil is a quality source of flaxseed oil, as the company is well-known and reputable. One tip: keep your flaxseed oil away from light and heat, as both degrade the oil. The usual beneficial dose of Flaxseed Oil is 2-3 capsules once per day taken with a meal.  The benefits of Flaxseed Oil are cumulative.  Commit to taking it every day without fail.  Like any herbal supplement, don't expect dramatic quick results.  The results you get will be subtle at first and then build over time.  For specific conditions such as Rhematoid arthritis, exzema, psoriasis, acne, etc,. the results should be apparent in 4-8 weeks.  Be patient!  Know that even if you don't ""feel"" different, you are sill protecting your body from the harmfull effects of many disease conditions.  Jim ""Konedog"" Koeni",5.0,positive

Now, three weeks later, I'm even more elated than I was during that first shave. After using Braun shavers for my last two, this Panasonic is a revalation. I researched new shavers for a couple hours, and narrowed it down to this Panasonic and the comparable (and comparably expensive) Braun system. Perhaps the latest Braun would have made me happy, too, but I won't be switching back.What do I like about the ES8162? For starters, the blades move at a consistent speed, which is higher than my old Braun. The blades maintain speed, even when the shaver's battery is low, something that plagued my old Braun, which in the end I had to keep plugged in 100% of the time. The consistently high speed of the Panasonic means less razor burn, at least on my face.The other thing I love is being able to shave wet or dry. I thought this was a ""nice to have"" but I have quickly become addicted to shaving wet, with my Geo F. Trumper shaving soap and a real badger brush. Talk about a crazy combination of retro and modern! But the glycerin-based shaving soap feels so much better on my face, leaves it smooth and clean, and is the perfect lubricant for shaving with the Panasonic. The shaving brush is pure indulgence.I used to hate shaving. I wouldn't say I look forward to it now, but it's certainly become an experience with its own modest pleasure",5.0,positive

Second, the rollers are hot to the touch so burning can be an issue when rolling up your hair. Third, the clips used to hold the rollers in place are fantastically difficult to use. I would roll up my hair (which would take like, 30 minutes because of the difficulty), and if I walked around the house to watch TV while I waited for my hair to set, the clips would spring out of place and shoot across the room.

The original Swiffer sweeper makes a quick job of sweeping, especially dust and hair, which will leave your floors bare and mopping becomes a much cleaner and less hassle free job.The mopping cloths are put on the Swiffer sweeper in the same manner as the dry cloths. They're extremely similar except these are, obviously, wet from being soaked in a cleaning solution. Also, the mopping cloths have a little scrubbing edge (which I found I didn't even have to use).I've used the Swiffer Wet Jet which is made especially to mop but think I prefer this method. like a regular mop, the cleaning solution is already on the pad (or sponge in the traditional sense) compared sot the Wet JEt where you spray it and often cannot see exactly where it goes. Also, the regular Swiffer sweeper is made of metal components, compared to the plastic handle of the Wet Jet, and feels much more sturdy while it's still light weight. This allows you to scrub a little harder, with a little more ""elbow grease"" than the Wet Jet. The mopping pads also feel like they're more secure with the Swiffer Sweeper and stay still better. The velcro adhesion of the Wet Jet doesn't seem this way and the thinner mopping pads do just as good of a job as the Wet Jet's pads, without coming apart like the Wet Jet pads often do, feeling like a diaper or taking up as much room.For my 3 small rooms, 1 mopping pad almost, but not quite, did the trick. it was easy to scrub off spots and the wet mopping pads actually took care of a few spots the Wet Jet had left previously, not matter how hard I scrubbed.I'm shocked I've never used this product before - it's great and I would recommend it to anyone.

The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves. That was an excellent product. However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher. I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to ""migrate"" its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model. I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be. I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none. I'm lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn't cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to. What's the deal? Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product? That they'd rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one? If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off. I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it. So much for my customer loyalty. I'll either switch brands or stop shaving until there's another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3",1.0,negative

My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said ""this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth"" or some such statement like that. Well, I haven't lost one yet. The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing. Since I've always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I'm using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth. It's kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.

5809,391637,"This is a well-made device of useful, though limited, value. It's usefulness derives from its consistency, which is amazing. Given that your body composition varies throughout the day, particularly your level of hydration, the Omron measurements vary by only fractions of a percent - exactly what you would expect.It measures small electric currents running from one electrode, through your body, to the second electrode. The Omron is programmed to estimate your body fat by measuring the impedance of your body to the flow of electricity. So, one might think that such a measurement would be straightforward, like on a weight scale. Electricity encounters fat, muscle, bone, and fluids and the Omron interprets the current and displays your body fat percent. Right? After all, when you step on a scale, the scale responds by showing your weight. You don't need to tell the scale whether you think you are an athlete or how old you are. It simply measures your weight. Well, the Omron doesn't work that way, nor do other similar devices, nor do skin-fold calipers. It looks to me as though electrical and skin-fold devices all simply measure surface body fat. Then they require that you input other data, such as your activity level (""normal"" or ""athlete"" in the Omron case) and age. This is not good because it introduces general population averages into what should be specific measurements of YOU. For instance, regardless of your body, it is assumed that the older you are, the more internal fat you have. The resulting body fat estimates are dramatically different when factoring in those variables.The Omron (and calipers) is still useful, though, if you consider it to be a compass rather than a scale. You can't be sure that it can tell you where you are, but, over time, it can tell you where you are going.",4.0,positive

Fish oil was believed to alleviate some of the problems with this condition. I was a control volunteer without eye problems and was used solely as a baseline for this study. My assigned dose was 15000 MG per day, or 15 capsules - 5 with each meal. This is 5 to 6 times the dosage recommendations on the bottle.In a nutshell, the physiological change over 4 months was remarkable at this dosage. My blood pressure reduced significantly, the ""good lipid"" HDL levels went way high, the ""bad lipid"", LDL, went way down. My skin and hair were very healthy, even during the dry winter months. And although it may just be a symptom of being healthier, libido increased dramatically as well. The only side effects of this routine was the occasional ""fish burps"" as mentioned by other users, but these aren't as bad when you take the capsules after a meal or right before bedtime, and over time you do get used to the gaseous anomolies. The benefits far outweigh the side effects.I recommend taking at least 10,000 Mg a day for best results. Just remember, each capsule is 25 calories, all from fat.

I've been using the same Fusion blade now --daily on my face, and just about every third day on my head-- and despite some claims to the contrary, it's still going strong... after almost three weeks!! Why has my blade lasted this long, despite my pretty heavy usage? EVERY time I shave, after thoroughly rinsing the blade, I GIVE IT A QUICK SPRAY WITH SHOWER CLEANER. (Such as ""Clean Shower"" or any of the no-wipe cleaners that you spray after using the shower.)Then I set the razor so it's standing with the cartridge end down.This does two things. The shower cleaner ensures that no film of water remains to dry on the edges of the blades, leaving spots for microscopic rusty areas to form,) and standing the razor blade-side-down makes sure that gravity takes any debris or water that MIGHT be left on the blade, DOWN and AWAY from the blade edge, since the edge of the blades face UP when you have the cartridge down.Prior to doing this on the Mach III blades, I'd also get about 3 or 4 good shaves out of a blade... but once I tried it, I got as many as 30. It makes a HUGE difference! I should also point out that I almost never get nicks and cuts. (I've been shaving my head for about 4 years, and I think I've nicked it shaving ONCE... .part of the reason is because I'm very careful about using my blade-cleaning technique.)Note to Gillette...

My skin is far too delicate and sensitive to tolerate most OTC acne products. I bought this product out of desperation, not believing it would work. After reading hundreds of reviews and advice and testing it for 2 weeks, I have found that it works well, with some modifications. My experience: cystic acne goes through its normal cycle (rising to surface, becoming a hideous scab, etc.) in a fraction of the normal time (4 days versus 4 weeks) when treated as directed with Zeno, OR it disappears completely without ever having risen to the surface (after a week or so), when treated very aggressively with Zeno. My advice: Don't expect it to work after 1-3 treatments and in 24 hours as advertised. Do know that with diligence and patience, it will work. Be very aggressive. Do double-cycles (allow the Zeno to remain on your skin after it beeps, then press the button for a second cycle) every few hours as long as the bump is detectable in any way. You may get very slight burning of your skin (causing a whitish film or slight peeling) and you may go through your cartridge tips quickly, but believe me, it's worth it to avoid the horrible months-long process of cystic acne.

It is estimated that over 50 million Americans suffer from some sort of insomnia. While we all have occasional nights when we struggle to fall asleep, nothing can describe the frustration of struggling to go to sleep night after night! Medical science recognizes the strong association between good health and good quality sleep. What is the best way to treat insomnia? Because of limited time and lack of understanding of the natural sleep cycle, many conventional doctors prescribe strong sleeping tablets for insomnia like Diazepam (Valium), Lorazapam, Alprazolam, etc. These can be highly addictive and if used for more than a week or two can result in a lifetime of dependence. Using strong drugs to fall asleep often means that the body's natural sleep cycle is disturbed and the ability to fall asleep naturally is lost. The person often needs to take stronger and stronger medication in order to fall asleep at night. Grogginess in the morning is not uncommon. Somnatrol is unlike any other product of its kind. The unique ingredients in this officially licensed Somnazide product when taken 30-60 minutes before bedtime will start relaxing your body. This feeling of relaxation is the formulas Stage 1 components taking effect. Shortly thereafter you are put into a restful sound sleep as the Stage 2 components take over. Somnatrol is a great way to end your day by both easing stress and supporting a restful night sleep. Mental and physical health depend upon the ability to relax and sleep without interruption.",5.0,positive

I find this bias is reflected in the game. As a game in itself, it is pretty good -  its graphics and its originality - and learning to relax and chill out may be useful for some people. I didn't find the process as compelling as I expected, though. I found I was able to learn some of the skills pretty fast, and other places I seemed to get stuck. One potential drawback is that if you get frustrated, and try to start forcing things to happen, it can defeat the purpose of meditation.The science of biofeedback is fairly new, and I can see its potential in the field of preventative health.

5970,B0000AFUT3:the_best_lighted_makeup_mirror_for_the_money....:glowing_gal,"Here's why.... I searched high and low for a decent lighted makeup mirror similiar to the one I had for years. My old mirror was a Windmere, lasted about 12 years. Prior to that I had a Clairol (lighting was just OK). Days of web searches led me to those horrible round halo lighted mirrors (they just look good on a counter) and serve no purpose. This Jerdon is basically the same mirror as my old Windmere. Very sturdy, great lighting, large rectangle mirror, side mirrors, vertical 360' rotation, 5X magnification on reverse side of mirror and 11 mirror positions, also an extra electrical outlet on front for appliances. The ISSUE regarding previous reviewers complaints about the lighting. You MUST hold the ON button down about 3 seconds to allow for the bulbs to light. The lighting on this mirror is superior to others I have seen. It weighs about 6 lbs and folds nicely away. The negatives to this mirror are: the bulbs make a slight buzzing noise when in use (typical of this type of bulb) and the electrical outlet was installed upside down on my product, therefore the mirror must be collapsed to a lower position to allow enough room for the plug. I consider these to be minor complaints considering the product services all my needs. If you want to go out of the house looking like you intend, this is the mirror for you. I would definitely buy again",5.0,positive

I rushed to the store, but it wasn't even on sale yet.  Finally I found it yesterday at walgreen's- and I hate to say- it stinks!I have just below shoulder length curly hair.  I generally throw in some gel and let it air dry- I hate spending a lot of time on my hair.  But once in a while I straighten it- which involves blow dry with a round brush, and then using a ceramic flatiron to finish.  I am not very good with a hair dryer, and it takes me a long time and I find it awkward managing the brush and the dryer, and I don't do a very good job.  Plus then I need to use the iron too, and it takes me a good 30-45 min total.So I thought this product would be great.  All in one! A time-saver! Easier to use!Well, I was wrong.First of all, it took about twice as long just to dry my hair as it would with my hairdryer.  It's not very powerful.  Next, it was barely straight!  Even on the ""4"" setting, there wasn't much tension at all.  It left my hair puffy and frizzy and barely straight.  So after an hour, I had hair that was not as straight as if I had just dried it alone- and I still needed to use the flatiron.Don't be fooled.  It will NOT give you the flat sleek hair that they picture on the box.I just hope I can return it.Guess I will stick with my CHI iron for now.I *might* try the ""long hair"" version of this dryer to see if that's any better",1.0,negative
5980,585728,"I'm 26m, 6' 185 and growing.  Work out regularly, mostly weights and basketball.  I'm allergic to peanuts, which makes most protein bars off-limits for me.  This is the only bar I've found where the non-peanut flavors don't contain trace amounts of peanuts to set off my allergies.  Incredible, if for only that reason.  But there's more.20g of protein.  Wow.  This can be a meal replacement if you're on the road or it can be the mid-morning, early-evening or even late-night snack, especially if you're trying to build lean muscle and shooting for 1.5 or more grams of protein per pound of body weight.  It's an easy 20.The carbs are real, as another review says.  It's clean energy, to be effective either before or after a workout.  I prefer to take in liquid protein after a workout, the body absorbs it faster, but in a pinch this would be a great choice.  Beyond that it's a little crispy and a little chewy, there's a physical satisfaction from eating it that makes the experience complete.  But, as another review said, this isn't intended to be a diet bar, it is for men & women who work hard and use lots of energy throughout the day, hence the name ""Builders Bar.""  I guess if you ate half of one instead of a meal, it might work that way.Finally the taste is outstanding, when stacked against other bars (although I haven't tried many, due to peanut allergies).  If you close your eyes and pretend, it really could be a dessert.  I stick to the cookies & cream or chocolate.  Chocolate is yummy dunked in hot coffee mid-morning.I buy a box every two weeks and keep stocked at home, work and oftentimes one in the car just in case I get hungry.  Another review said the outside chocolate got crumbly, this is true, if it gets hot and melted.  When the things solidify they crumble.  Doesn't change the taste but it's messy.

Understand two things: that I am moving up to an electric epilator from sugaring, and I don't have overly heavy hair growth. It works very well, even on underarms which sugaring was useless for. I do agree with one reviewer that folds can be tricky, but stretching the skin helps. I didn't find the ice feature all that important, but then I had sugared before so I was familiar with the stinging (yes it does sting). I definitely have used the product for much more than 15 minutes and have had no motor problem, but I have only owned it for a couple of weeks so I can not speak about long-term durability. I would hope that the person with motor trouble trimmed any really long hair(such as in the bikini area and beyond if you are a first time user) before using because several machines recommend this however the directions for using the satinelle ice are a six panel wordless cartoon that left me scratching my head wondering ""is this a joke?"" Especially when the warnings and cleaning instructions are a multi-page, mult-language extremely clear instruction booklet: one quibble for an otherwise great product. There may be better a better epilator out there so read the other reviews. I thought the ice would be a better thing than it was, but then I was used to the stinging from sugaring - if you have never epilated, waxed or sugared - you may find it very important. I liked the narrowness of it for the bikini line and handling. I do wish it had a light like some other models have. Still, I am very pleased with my purchase",5.0,positive

Well, these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned, and had promised also to change dry and brittle hair to long and healthy, and it did absolute NOTHING. I said to myself, like hair formula 37, that maybe I just need to give this more time, so I bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all. This product might just work for others, which it has, but it certainly didn't work for me. I must admit that I brought this on myself, as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway, and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like Giant or even hair vitamins in the damn Dollar Store! These hair growth pills are too damn expensive, so when you are paying all of that money then you expect it to work. The fact that it does not is infuriating because $39.99 + $7 in shipping, with a total of a little over $46, is a lot of money to spend on something that does nothing.

My main problem was that I was the only one strong enough to fill and carry the tanks, so I was on permanemt ""water carrier"" duty.

6138,205689,"Although I have used many electronic cuff devices in the past, this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings.      Firstly, the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way.       In a clinical setting, it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings. It is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement. I have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what I considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way. Imagine had I taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result.     As a rule, I never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings. Many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security.

It's not often that you can find one that is suited for both curly and straight styles.  The air diffusing attachment is perfect for creating soft, frizz free curls while the concentrator nozzle (more narrow and therefore a better conductor of air than most models with this feature) allows you to direct air exactly where you want it.  The dryer itself features two speed (low and high) and three heat settings (cool, warm and hot), as well as a cold shot button to lock in style.  For the highest heat setting, simply put the dryer on high speed and the hottest setting (careful, though...this is only recommended for hair that's UBER curly, like mine).  Additionally, the 9 foot long cord (complete with a loop that will allow you to hook it onto something in your bathroom or wherever else you store it) makes it really easy to use.  Another bonus: even on the highest setting, the dryer is considerably more quiet than other ones on the market that are similarly priced (you can easily hold a conversation while speaking in a normal tone of voice).According to the information that's included with the product, the dryer is made with a combination pink tourmaline/ceramic technology that allows for a special emission of ions (these are important for eliminating static electricity).  I found that after use, my hair actually was a lot smoother even than when I used previous hair dryers with ionic technology; I used it to style my hair both in its naturally curly state and after setting it in rollers to blow dry it straight.  If your hair is really curly like mine, however, you might still want to use a flatiron to get that pin-straight look.  But for less curly hair or hair that's less prone to frizz, that probably won't be necessary.Although this is by far my favorite hair dryer I've ever owned, I do agree with the previous comment on this product: it really would be the perfect dryer if it had a folding handle.

This set had all of that and then some! It's got 8 of the jumbo-sized rollers, which I was having a hard time finding, plus six 1-1/4 inch rollers and six 1-inch size. I have fine but thick straight hair that varies from just below the shoulders to bra-strap length, and with this set I can either do all-large rollers for body and a little wave, or use multiple small rollers for lots of curl. Plus, it came with both types of clips--the plastic ""jaws"" kind, and the U-shaped metal clips. I should say, I bought my set from a beauty supply store in my city, and I bought it on clearance for less than it retails here. Nevertheless I feel lucky to have found it and I would have paid more.  The rollers  heat very fast and hold the heat for quite a while, so I can get a good tight curl if I let them heat for 15 minutes and cool for 30.

Acetaminophen to take care of sore, throats and body or headaches. the other is Dextromethorphan HBr, which is some really good stuff for controlling the cough. My problem is getting it down.

My first was the 6756X Advantage which I still use occasionally, followed a few years later with a Norelco 8894XL Spectra. Both of these shaver still work well. The reason I purchased the new 7775X is because after 7 years of use my 6756X will only hold charge for a few shaves, otherwise works perfectly.Although I have had my new 7775X shaver for a short time, it seems to provide as close a shave as my old unit.Pros:The 7775X has a more secure changing base than the old unit (deeper).The message display provides a good status of the shaver to include the battery charge which the old unit did not indicate until it was near depleted.The unit still maintains the shaving cream/gel dispenser. This is especially useful it you travel frequently like I do. No more worries about having my shaving cream confiscated.Cons:If you primarily use the shaver dry then the rinse indicator is useful. My purchasing in/out of shower shavers is to have the ability to always use it wet and with some type of cream or gel. I find the closeness of the shave is equal to any bladed razor I have ever used, without the nicks and cuts.I would not recommend suspending the shaver on the supplied plastic hanger strap which is not near as secure as with my old unit. It looks like it could easily be disconnected allowing the unit to fall and possibly break.Overall, I am very satisfied with my new 7775X. I expect it will provide the same long life service and close shave that my old unit did.I would recommend that you keep you unit clean and charged as required and most importantly change the shaver heads once a year, as recommended.

Compare the cost to buying a 60 day supply of the 4 different pills at your local market. A great deal and a convenient way to take my vitamins. Recently I went on a road trip and was gone a little over a week. These little single sealed packets, were convenient and took up much less room then then bringing all the bottles along. It was also an easy way to remember whether I took them. I brought 10 packs with me, so each day I put one in my pocket to take with breakfast. The vitamins in the packet are your basic and essential needs. Calcium, for building strong bones, B-Complex, helping to convert food into energy, Vitamin C to boost my immune system, and a multivitamin/multimineral high potency formula providing 29 vitamins and minerals(see buying info for supplement facts and %DV). These also now contain Luetein, for eye health. The only supplement it doesn't come with that I think many women would want or need is some extra ferrous sulfate(iron), so when on the go, you may need to bring those with you, or be sure to eat foods high in iron. The Vit C by the way, helps with absorbing the iron into the body. So for convenience and an easy way to remember and get your vitamins on the go I would give this pack 4 stars(if it had the iron I would have gone 5). If you are taking your vitamins with breakfast, but breakfast isn't until a 10:00 am breakfast meeting, just throw one of these little packs in your purse, pocket or briefcase. Check the Nature-Made product site here for other vitamin needs. Occasionally they have special deals(rebates, etc), and buying them in up to a 90 day supply here almost always seems to be a better deal then buying them at the grocery store. There are no Artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, chemical solvents, yeast or gluten added. Remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy!(and don't forget your vitamins!)...Laurie",4.0,positive

The Braun Epilator removes all hairs long enough to be tweezed, leaving behind ingrown hairs and some micro-hairs, hairs too short to be tweezed.

There's a small magnet on the tip, but the magnet isn't very strong. Won't pick up a glass or soda can because the jaws aren't wide enough, but that hasn't been an issue for her.  There are other types of extenders you can buy, if you need this capability.-  Dressing Aid - She keeps this upstairs for use in the bed and bath and uses it like another reach extender to pick up clothes and towels.  Can also be used to put on slippers more easily than the shoe horn.-  Sock Aid - ingenious device that really works.  It's a bit stiff which requires some effort to get a sock on it, but probably will loosen with use.  Even works with nylon hosiery.-  Shoe horn and long handled sponge - nothing fancy, but they do the job.I spent the first 5 days at home helping her out, but after that, this kit along with an elevated toilet seat are the only items she needed to take care of herself and allowed me to return back to work.Bonus tip: her surgeon suggested using plastic food wrap to wrap around her leg, hip and torso to keep her dressing dry while showering.

6289,B000FKK0IC:great_razor!:nicole_martinez,"Schick is a top name in razors overall but it's also always had a lead on the competition with its Silk Effects razor. While the Silk Effects is still in demand, Schick came out with the Quattro for Women, probably to compete with Gilette's Venus, and this ""newer"" razor lives up to its competition in many ways.Women have been using their husbands' razors for ages because they shave more accurately and with more precision so it only makes sense to simply modify a man's razor to fit a woman, which is exactly what Schick has done with this product.This razor even feels like it's something more substantial than your basic woman's razor because one of its main elements: metal. Unlike other plastic razors, this razor feels (and looks) much more substantial, perhaps because it feels tougher and heavier; it is not a razor I would readily throw away - nor would I want to as both razor and replacement blades cost quite a bit even if the prices are on par with other leading razors. It feels more like a man's razor. And, one might argue that it is but even the elements from the regular Quattro can be considered an improvement over regular female razors. Both the Quattro and the Quattro for women boast 4 precise blades, a metal handle which might actually help shaving accuracy, comfort grips.The Quattro for women gives us something a little more. Obviously, it's been ""feminized"" by changing the colour from black to pink but this razor also has a pivoting head to make shaving feminine curves easier and a conditioning strip.Enough with the advertising, though. This is a good razor. If it's not #1 on the market then it's #2 without doubt and for good reason. I shave many parts of my body and I always get at least a good shave, if not better, with the Quattro.I do find that this razor works best for certain parts of my body, however, and I will not be giving up my Venus anytime soon. While I can get a good shave on my legs and underarms, I prefer to use this razor for my bikini line and bikini area. I find Areas prone to razor bumps and rash shave much more nicely and do not become as irritated with my Quattro but areas that are shaved fine with my Venus, do not seem to shave as smoothly with the Quattro.This blade seems to dull fairly easily as well, though perhaps it's because I tend to use it on more dense hair. You really cannot stretch it out for ""just one more"" shave. When it dulls, razor bumps and irritation increase almost exponentially and, more than once, the numerous blades have ""tugged"" at my hair and skin.There are other elements of the Quattro worth discussing than just the quality of shave, however. This razor comes with a handy, compact suction cup holder to stick to your shower wall or door. Although sometimes it seems to fall, it usually holds up well and is quite an improvement over the bulky holder the Venus has. Nevertheless, this holder does not have any place to store your extra razor blades. Furthermore, you wouldn't want to store your blades in your shower as the case they are in, those sleek it is, is not entirely enclosed and the moisture will deteriorate the moisture strips on the blades. Therefore, if you're like me and remember you need to change your blade only once you are in the shower, you'll have to jump out of the shower to do it.However, my complaints really do not overshadow this quality product. It's still top of the line and, since I have purchased it, I have been extremely pleased at the quality though I will still continue to use my Venus for some parts of my body",5.0,positive

My Body Fat measurements were fairly consistent, with it not varying by more than 1% from day to day.BUT!!! The main suspicion I have with this scale is that it seems to have a ""lazy"" weight measurement change. What do I mean by that? Let's say, for example, you weight yourself and the scale says 154lbs. If you step off, take off a jacket u know weights about 1.5lbs, and step on the scale again, the scale will show that you still weight 154lbs. BUT! And here is when it gets interesting, I suspected that the scale might have a 'short-term' memory built into its eletronics and will simply go back to the most recently measured weight if the difference in weight is small enough. SO, I weighted myself, at say, 154, then made the scale go to some other weight, say 130, and then take off my jacket and weight myself again, and guess what? I now get 152.5lbs.

6431,B0006ZM4LC:best_price_vs_performance:photographics,"I waited a couple of weeks to write this review so I could let my face get used to a new razor.Background:  I have used Norelco rotary shavers since I began to shave as a teen.  My skin has always been sensitive and any time I tried a non-rotary shaver my face would become red and irritated.  I also felt I was getting the closest electric shave possible with a rotary shaver.  Sometimes I will go several days without shaving and as much as I liked rotaries, they do not do well on a heavy beard growth.The switch:  Whenever the blades needed replacing on my rotary shavers I would buy a whole new razor.  The price of replacement blades is almost as much as the shaver itself.  My most recent Norelco served me well but in recent months shaving became a dreaded experience.  Norelco uses a motor rather than a vibrator like most other shavers and it can tend to slow down when the blades are dull and the beard is thick.The decision:  Although I have never had luck with non-rotary shavers I tried a friend's Braun once and was surprised how much closer it shaved and how my face felt good afterward.  His was the cheap $29 model and I would have been happy with it, but I liked the style of the Model 5775.  Anything more expensive seemed to be just more gimmicks. I simply cannot see what would justify over $100 for an electric razor.The review:  This is the closest shaving razor I have ever owned and it actually makes shaving a pleasure.  The wider head and the way the various slots are arranged lets me shave by gliding the razor over my face.  No pressure needed.The bad:  It feels big and heavy (which can be taken as a positive ... is feels remarkably well built).  The swivel head is pure gimmick.  It doesn't swivel during normal shaving and seems to be useless.  Braun could have made the shaver smaller, lighter and with fewer parts prone to break if they left that ""feature"" off.Highly recommended - excellent value.",5.0,positive

6452,438490,"This review is about the Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said ""this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth"" or some such statement like that. Well, I haven't lost one yet. The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing. Since I've always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I'm using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth; it's kind of hard to deny it works. My dentist has confirmed this on direct examination.Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.

6482,"B000FKLIL0:an_expensive_form_of_aspirin:james_koenig_""konedog4""","Bayer is a name-brand aspirin.  Any brand-name drug will cost at least double of that of the equivalent generic aspirin.  I give this a one-star rating not because it is a poor product, rather, because it is so expensive. The dosage is 325 mg, taken two at a time, is the normal dose.   Aspirin is a wonder-drug, the very first analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to hit the market over 100 years ago. It is for mild to moderate pain and treats many different conditions such as arthritis, bone inflammation, joint pain, and even reduces fever. Aspirin causes blood platelets to not adhere to each other, thus it ""thins"" the blood and prevents blood clots from forming. Aspirin is thus used in emergency treatment of heart attacks and strokes. Some folks take a ""baby"" aspirin (81-160 mgs) each day to prevent blood clots from forming. Aspirin is actually acetyl-salicylic acid. Manufacturers alter the structure of aspirin slightly to grant it different properties in terms of its digestion, to make digestion easier. Some buffer it with antacids while others coat the tablet with a coating that prevents its digestion in the stomach (like Ecotrin). Regular aspirin, without any buffering or coatings is tolerated by most people, but some cannot take it without severe stomach upset. For these folks, the buffered form is a god-send. Unfortunately, Aspirin fell out of favor in the 60's and 70's when Reye's Syndrome developed in some children (under the age of 16) who took aspirin while they had the flu and/or chickenpox. About 30% of the children affected died and many more had permanent brain damage. Because of Reye's Syndrome, alternate analgesics were placed on the market, the premier being Tylenol. There is no reason to fear using aspirin if you are an adult, as Reye's Syndrome only occurred in children under 16 years of age. The usual dose of aspirin is 350 mg, with the ""extra-strength form at 500 mg. Most adults will easily tolerate a dose of 650 mg (2 tablets) every 4 hours with a maximum daily dose of 5,200 mg. (Some with rheumatoid arthritis take up to 7200 mg/day with a doctor's supervision). There is no additional benefit to taking more than 1,000 mg every 4 hours. Increasing the dose beyond this point will only increase the toxicity of aspirin. Aspirin should be avoided in people taking blood-thinning medications, those with stomach ulcers, and used with caution in insulin-dependent diabetics. Allergies can develop to aspirin as well. Never mix aspirin with any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, such as Ibuprofen, as there is no pain benefit and the gastric upset chance is greatly increased. Don't mix aspirin with alcohol either, as it is hard on the stomach. Used properly, aspirin is a terrific medication. I prefer to buy my aspirin in a generic form.

I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it's still not as good as a blade and it takes some persistence to really get some of the flat-lying hairs on my neck. It is definitely better than other electrics I have used, although I swore them off for poor performance and haven't used one regularly for probably 10 years. I bought this shaver since I do a fair amount of travel, and it's easier to carry on an electric with all the restrictions these days. The unit is pretty lightweight -- none of the fancy charging bases and cleaning solutions to weigh you down. The non-rigid carrying case is easy to pack in amongst other stuff.For me, the razor held a charge for about 10 days of pretty extensive use, working well for me right up to the time the battery died a quick death. A couple hours of charge and it was good to go for another 10 days or more. My first charge was done in India, and as advertised the shaver dealt well with the higher voltage electricity.If you want a good, reliable, no frills shaver, this seems like a good bet.",4.0,positive

The chair does take up a good bit of space, perhaps 4 feet wide and at full extension 6.5 feet long.The function: The control panel is pretty extensive, with sort of quick massage functions for swedish etc, as well as controls for picking out specific areas to focus on.  So you can go with the pre-built massages or use the customization to create one on the spot for what you need (and can save it).  Customizing the massage is takes probably 20 minutes of tinkering to figure out, so not totally easy but certainly not hard either.The only negative I see with it is the chair is clearly designed for people under 6 feet tall.  I am 5'10 and can just barely get my legs fully extended in the chair, so it works but would not if I was 6'.

I finally visited a dermatologist, and he put me on an Accutane regimen.  I had sensitive skin and a tough beard, so regular shaving cream was too harsh (especially while taking Accutane - the solid brush-on cream I was using at the time burned the edges of my lips).  He recommended that I shave with Cetaphil.  Years later, my skin and beard are still troublesome.  Therefore, I've kept Cetaphil as a part of my shaving regimen.Cetaphil goes on well and provides a nice lubrication for my shaver.  It's not harsh or irritating, even on a freshly shaved face.  However, it's kind of cold in the morning, which is a bit counter-productive after heating my face with hot water and shower steam to soften the whiskers.  So I put the bottle on the tub floor while showering to heat it up with the runoff.  By the time I'm done, it's warm enough for application after rubbing some around my hands for a second or two.  However, even though Cetaphil feels good and lubricates well, its consistency is a bit thin to use alone.  I like a good lather, so I combine Cetaphil with Kiss My Face Moisture Shave, which was recommended to me by a woman working at GNC.  They mix well together, and I get a good, non-irritating shave by using the Gillette Fusion Power razor.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I apply a product that contains salicylic acid, such as Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.If you have a razor-challenging beard and skin combination like me, then make Cetaphil part of your shaving routine.

6539,137423,"I'm writing to correct a few factual errors in other reviews.  One reviewer claimed that Soldier Fuel contains no energy ingredients.  This is untrue.  Soldier Fuel was formulated by military labs specifically to provide steady energy to troops.  Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy.  Soldier Fuel contains 29 g of complex carbs (the carbs that give long-lasting energy) and 12 g of sugar.  The U.S. Military labs deemed this the perfect ratio to give you both a quick burst of energy and no crash.  Most other energy drinks on the market have lots of sugar and caffeine.  Since caffeine is a stimulant and not a source of energy, the result is a quick spike in energy followed by a crash.   Another error is that Soldier Fuel has more sugar.  It has less.  One 12 oz. can of Soldier Fuel has 12 g of sugar.  The same amount of Gatorade contains 21 g of sugar.  The same amount of Red Bull has 39g sugar.Finally, the support for the troops is not marketing hype.  Our company is partnered with the U.S. Military's Natick Soldier Center.

6553,B000A23CQM:best_norelco_yet.:d._greer,This shaver replaced a Norelco Advantage (6 years old) that was shaving good but would no longer hold a charge for more than a couple of days.  I can't honestly say if it shaves as close as a blade because I haven't shaved with a blade in many years.      I have used foil shavers in the past (Braun and Panasonic) and though they might shave closer than a rotary the cost to replace the foils and the nicks that you get is not worth it.    I have been using this shaver for about 3 months.  During that time I have charged it only twice including the initial charge and that is using it at least every other day.  At first I thought it was underpowered because it is so quiet but soon found out that it shaves much closer than my old Advantage which I thought was doing a great job.   It shaves quick and close ( Personally I think as close as a blade).  When you are done shaving you just rinse it under the tap and let it dry. It doesn't get any easier than that. I have cleaned the heads once as stated in the instructions and that is easy too.    The only con is I have dry sensitive skin and have not seen any difference between the 3 comfort settings. Use electric shave before shaving and I think that you will agree that it shaves as close as a blade without the irritation.  Highly recommended and worth the price.,5.0,positive

6555,B000AYYK5M:good_steam_for_9_minutes:isis,"I was worried about reading the lack of steam by another reviewer but most reviewers seemed happy with it, so I bought it.  Using plain tap water (our Maryland water is hard), the inhaler made strong, gentle, steady steam in less than 45 seconds.  The steam lasted about 9 minutes before it decreased.  I would like to have the steam last longer but as it was with trying to breath as fast and as deeply as I could, I was almost hyperventilating in the 9 minutes.  The unit has to cool down before you can add more water and you are warned not to over-fill the unit.  The mask is made of a soft, flexible plastic so it was comfortable.  I found it easiest just to hold the unit to my face, since resting it on a tissue box caused me to have to bend down.  You will probably need an extension cord, since the cord is not very long (if you are using a wall outlet) although if you are using a higher bathroom outlet, it would be fine.It was very easy to fill - open white top, unscrew lid, add measured water, put back together, and turn on.  The only little complaint is you should disassemble the pieces and let them dry, so I have had to leave the unit in pieces on a towel to dry for a day.I have always hated using the old fashioned method of putting my head over boiling water with a towel to breath in the steam.  This was much nicer and my face didn't get hot or feel burned.  I found this inhaler to be comfortable and convenient.I had a cold and with using this unit three or four times, I didn't get a sinus infection and I think it helped the cold to be less severe and go away faster.  I also rinse my sinuses with a Neti pot with a baking soda/salt solution and very warm water.  I have used the Neti pot before and still got a sinus infection but this time with using the steam inhaler, I didn't.For people with sinus problems, allergies, or prone to cold, I do think using a Neti pot to rinse your sinuses is very helpful.  I read about it in a ""Sinus Survival"" book and my good friend said she hasn't had a sinus infection in years since she started using a Neti Pot every day.  I only use the Neti pot when there is a lot of pollen, after yard work, been with lots of people (especially sick ones), when I have a stuffy nose or feel ""something"" coming on",5.0,positive

6574,355596,"I'm writing to correct a few factual errors in other reviews.  One reviewer claimed that Soldier Fuel contains no energy ingredients.  This is untrue.  Soldier Fuel was formulated by military labs specifically to provide steady energy to troops.  Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy.  Soldier Fuel contains 29 g of complex carbs (the carbs that give long-lasting energy) and 12 g of sugar.  The U.S. Military labs deemed this the perfect ratio to give you both a quick burst of energy and no crash.  Most other energy drinks on the market have lots of sugar and caffeine.  Since caffeine is a stimulant and not a source of energy, the result is a quick spike in energy followed by a crash.   Another error is that Soldier Fuel has more sugar.  It has less.  One 12 oz. can of Soldier Fuel has 12 g of sugar.  The same amount of Gatorade contains 21 g of sugar.  The same amount of Red Bull has 39g sugar.Finally, the support for the troops is not marketing hype.  Our company is partnered with the U.S. Military's Natick Soldier Center.

Philips acknowledges this is a problem but offers no solution.Also, there are many small crevices in/around the nameplate on the side, and a large gap under the nut for the brush-head that accumulates 'gook' on a daily basis. Philips advises that this is probably 'mold' and the brush should be 'disassembled and air-dried' after every use. It takes longer to do this than to brush my teeth--Again, while this is probably one of the best ways to clean your teeth at this point in time, and an economical way to try one of the products that normally start out at $64e (and up), there is no reason why the e3000 shouldn't be made as well as the better units, or hold up to water/daily use as well as some of the $9 Crest electrics we commonly see",2.0,negative

The recipe makes it sweeter, and certainly oilier, than eating an ordinary candy bar. I think a Snickers tastes better. For those who are using these as meal replacement bars, I'd be real careful. The bar might be 'balanced' but it isn't a meal. Whatever energy bar you consume, they're good before a workout or post-workout for recovery but don't confuse them with a proper meal and all the components found there.As for me, I prefer an Odwalla bar or Cliff bar.

But it does have the right ingredients that most top-rated sunscreens/sunblocks use, so it should be at least on par with them.Where this product really shines (or DOESN'T shine) is for people with combination/oily skin. I have tried MANY sunscreens, and it's so hard to find a sunscreen WITHOUT moisturizers (if you have oily skin, that's already your natural moisturizers).I have even tried other NEUTROGENA sunscreens that are supposed to be OIL FREE and all that. The result on my face? After applying it, I always SHINE (which is NOT what I want).This magnificent product, however, actually gives my face a nice MATTE finish... and matte FEEL, too! It's a pretty thick cream when you first apply it (as opposed to other suncreens or other products that feel more like LOTION), but is almost immediately absorbed by the skin. In 30 seconds, there is no more greasy/creamy feeling, and in one minute, if you feel your skin, there's a nice matte feel.HOWEVER, and this is not the fault of the product, after about 3 hours (at least for me), then I feel like the matte effect has worn off, and my oily skin is again showing its oily nature.Still, as far as suncreens go, this is the best I have tried for my skin, and I highly recommend it for people with combination/oily skin.BTW, this review is for the actual product I got, which is SPF 30. As of the time I am writing this review, here in amazon they also offer an SPF 45 version, and cheaper, too! I don't know the difference, but I always go for the LOWER one (in this case, SPF 30), because I theorize -- rightly or wrongly, I don't know -- that the lesser the SPF, the lesser the strength of the ingredients, so maybe it's better for sensitive skin (?)",5.0,positive

There are 250 calories packed into this little 2.4 ounce bar, which is advertised to be at least 70% organic.  This bar is advertised to be for athletes first, and as a casual snack second.  If you are overweight and trying to drop pounds, you can skip this snack and move back to unbuttered popcorn.When I opened this bar I noticed that it looks like compressed goop.  However, the compressed goop tastes pretty good.  The texture is much like a granola bar, though more moist than a granola bar.  The black cherry part of the black cherry almond is understated.  There are dried cherries in this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor, which is a big plus.  I was unable to find anything in this bar that implied it was artificial, which is an even bigger plus.One thing that confused me a little is that the bar is advertised to have no wheat and no dairy, but the label on the bar states that there may be trace amounts of dairy.  I guess they either knew there might be a very small amount of dairy or they were hedging themselves because of possible cross-contamination from some other process.  In either case, vegens consider whether trace amounts of dairy makes this an acceptable product.  The label also states that there may be traces of peanuts.This bar also contains 20% of the daily recommended dietary fiber, which means drinking lots of water is a good idea when eating this bar.  There are also lots of vitamins and trace elements, which may be a good thing unless you take vitamin supplements, in which case you may need to consider whether you are getting too much of a good thing.Clif Bars could be a casual snack, but the ingredients and their marketing really suggest that they are geared toward individuals that are looking for a healthy energy boost in high energy activities.

I've had the Cleancut/Femini combo for a couple months now except I have the Shavey Femini trimmer that isn't the t-bar. I find it great for managing angles, shapes, and tight spaces (I've heard the t-bar's motor is a little stronger if you prefer that). I applied some baby powder and in several minutes, it got the hair down to a good stubble and I shaped a nice and neat inverted triangle like I wanted. I'd been holding out on doing anything until the set arrived so naturally, it took longer because I had a lot of work to do. Coarse hair wasn't a problem for the little teeth though and I didn't get nicked, even while getting the pesky hair on the inner areas. I'd still say be careful around those parts though. The Cleancut fit along my curves nicely thanks to its smaller size and finishing the job was easy. To cut closer, you should run opposite the directional growth and pull the skin taught as you go. It isn't as close as a razor but I don't get any itchiness or rashes and FAR less ingrowns which are usually a big problem for me otherwise. I consider that a more than fair trade-off. Just make sure you're clean, dry, and powdered for the best results and substancially lessened chance of a possible bite or irritation...which you should probably do with most dry shavers anyway. I've tested it on a small area without dry lubricant and it CAN cause irritation so be sure to always use something. Baby powder is cheap and there are different kinds from talc to cornstarch based; regular, to scented, to medicated...and did I mention it's cheap?! Can't go wrong at a couple bucks for a big bottle of it. :P On another note, it's true the battery makes up for most of the unit's weight. But that makes no difference to me because it cuts through my coarse stubble with no problem or lag in spinning. It isn't loud but it does make an audible high humming noise. The noise wasn't enough to bother me and I consider myself pretty uptight about those things. You can use them on your facial hair too if wet shaving gives you ingrowns and you hate waxing...just uh, wash or wipe off the foil if you use it on your privates first, lol. Sometimes I even use it under my arms. Like most advertised things, it's not as miraculous and amazing as ads claim but you should already know not to ride entirely on them.

After the first full day, there was a noticable reduction in pain and size.  After two days, there was just a small red bump.  Three days almost nothing.  Fourth day, completely gone.  The best thing about the Zeno treatments, is that for me it immediately takes away the pain of the cyst.  It also reduced the swelling much quicker than if I did not use the Zeno.I had a friend tell me to leave the Zeno in place even after the ending beep.  The tip seems to get a little warmer, but it seemed to help in my situation.  I held the Zeno in place until I heard the continuous beeping.  Please use your own common sense on this.  I don't consider the tip too warm, but for some people it may be too painful.I used it every three or four hours for four days.  I used it mostly for pain relief from the cyst.  I never expected the cyst itself to go away.   18 treatments and the cyst is gone with no scarring.  Wish I would have had this sooner.For me it worked.  I definitely did not have the ""one time and it is gone"" experience.

It cannot be for real, can it? ""Here's your sign...""Did any of these people do ANY research before purchase? You can see this thing in any Wal-Mart or Target in America....I think these are the people who sue companies for having 'Hot coffee'....sheesh.Come on, folks, it is a RAZOR! I used a Norelco wet/dry for years, and was never quite satisfied. Too many passes, and the razor burn was bad. So, after dropping it on the floor and breaking it beyond repair, I tried this. With the rebate from Amazon, it was less than a Franklin bill to purchase shipped! The razor is great! almost as close as a blade. After 6 years in the Navy, where I learned to hate shaving _EVERY DAY_, I am finally doing it again, with no problems. There's no 'tug' like the lift and cut of Norelco, and I get less ingrown hairs, a continuous problem with the lift and cut system. The 'hum' of the Braun is different than the 'whirr' of the Norelco, but no louder or more annoying. The cleaning stand is great. I clean all the whiskers from my razor with the brush before putting it in the stand, and then remove the cleaning fluid after cleaning to slow evaporation. I will easily get two months, perhaps 3 from a cleaning cartridge, and that is with 6 days a week shaving (I skip Saturdays). After a trip, the deep clean makes this razor sparkling new! In the long run, a disposable razor, or even a Mach 3 replacable blade, will cost about 50 cents a day. (Including shaving cream, hot water, etc.) Heck, say 20 cents a day. After a year, that 20 cents a day adds up to $70...I got this convenient razor (I use it in the car, at my desk, in the bathroom, etc.) for just a few dollars more than that. Even after replacing the cutters at 18 months, I come out ahead on the $$$. A no-brainer. Electric razors are environmentally friendlier than disposable razors, cost effective, and just about as close as a blade with the newest technology.

However, unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by CliC, the Sport Googles do not adjust properly and so the Goggles run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem legnth, 2) there is also extra foam padding on the Sport Googles that make them very snug, but because of the tight stems the foam padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3)the maker doesn't make it as clear as they should in their description ... the Irridium (Red)colored lens on some of the Sports Goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking on a rocky path.

But around age 35 I looked in the mirror and realized my skin was getting that middle-age dullness to it.  Unwilling to pay for a professional microdermabrasion, I decided to try the Neutrogena at home system.  The Neutrogena Microdermabrasion cream is easy to apply.  The cream had the slightest pleasant smell, and was not sticky at all.  I used well less than a teaspoon, so a little goes a long way.  It was no problem to rinse it off my face with water, and the sponge was very easy to clean as well.  The treatment took me less than 10 minutes, fit in easily to my bedtime routine, and after the initial start-up treatments you only need to do it a couple times a week.My skin definitely felt softer, smoother and more invigorated.  I could notice a difference after only one treatment.  But the real proof came from the way my husband did a double take a couple days later and commented that I looked younger.  (He didn't know about the microdermabrasion.)  And even my 6 year old daughter told me my face looked pretty.  There was a clear and noticeable difference--after only a few treatments my middle-aged dull skin had definitely gotten back some of its youthful glow, and the few large pores I have did appear smaller.Being lazy, I have not incorporated it into my regular routine like I should, but I do pull it out a few days before special occasions, vacations, or anytime I feel the need for a little brightening up, and will definitely always keep it on hand.If you have particularly sensitive skin, this may not be a great product for you, as it is a bit, well, abrasive.

Prior to this curling/straightening iron, I owned a $150 Wet-to-Dry T3 Tourmaline flat iron (see my review), a $50 Jilbere flat iron, and a run-of-the-mill drugstore curling iron. The Conair does as good a job at straightening and smoothing my hair as the T3 or the Jilbere. Once I flat iron it, it stays so nice and smooth the next day it doesn't even require a minor touch up.I actually like the Conair better, because no matter how careful I was, the T3 was terrible at pulling my hair, and the Jilbere, while better, still caught the stray hair now and then. I have never gotten a hair snagged by the Conair. And I love having one less hair appliance/cord and one less cord cluttering my counter. I also really like that it has an auto turn off for forgetful people like me.  It is slightly more wieldy than a flat iron or curling iron alone, but that's almost always the case when you get a 2-in-1 anything. I think it's mainly due to having to account for the rounded outer shape when straightening. You have to hold it a little farther away from your scalp. I can't think how they could've made it easier, though, while still keeping the 2-in-1 design. It's easy to switch back and forth between curling iron and straightener. The power light and temp control are right on the front, so I can tell at a glance whether it's on or not. With the other flat irons, I had to look between the plates to see the light. One small nitpick is that I wish I could set the temp and it would default to the same temp everytime I turn it on. As it is, I have to turn it up every time. But the Conair is an amazing bargain. For less than $30 and to have the convenience of a curling iron / straightener in one, I am highly impressed.

As a full-time undergraduate student, I cannot afford to visit the salon on a weekly basis. I purchased this flat iron on a whim at the market because my previous flat iron had recently shorted out (it was an older model with no swivel cord). I chose this flat iron because it was the same brand as my last one, and I was overwhelmingly satisfied with its performance. I cannot say the same for this product. In retrospect, it does exactly what it claims to do, but nothing beyond that. With my previous flat iron, I could straighten and style my layered hair at the same time, which significantly cut the amount of heat and damage my hair had to endure. Any attempts to style my hair were underwhelming to say the least. After using the flat iron, my hair looked fizzy and unkempt, and even a bit damaged. Any curls I managed to produce looked undefined and limp. It was by chance that I purchased a curling iron in addition to the flat iron, and was able to successfully style my hair after wrapping my hair overnight and applying frizz control serum. Needless to say, you won't be able to produce that ""fresh from the salon"" look with this flat iron, which is sadly exactly what I needed. I do not feel confident about my hair when stepping out of the house after using this product. If you don't use this tool for anything but sleek, straight looks and have a bottle of frizz serum handy, then this is a great product for you. While I am not happy with its results, it will have to do for now. I'll be saving for a better iron while praying that straightening AND curling my hair doesn't leave it severely damaged.",2.0,negative

So if you need to feel better about your nose and/or throat, go for it.My main complain about the Grossan Hydro Pulse is that it is noticeably expensive. Some time ago, Grossan was making just his own irrigator tip matching it to a Waterpik machine that cost a half the price of the Hydro Pulse. But then, Grossan decided to produce his own machine and, if I'm right, Viajet is making it for him. Viajet sells the same machine, except for the Grossan tip, at about -again- a half the price of the Hydro Pulse.  The Breathe-ease solution that you might use along with the irrigator is also expensive (I have check this comparing it with a simillar product that can be purchased in my country).So what makes the Hydro Pulse so expensive? Maybe health is a business, after all.Other than that, like I have said, this product is great for almost any respiratory problem. I used to irrigate my nose with a similar solution that comes in a 135 ml bottle, and is intended to use it over 50 times.

The sponge is about the size of a regular kitchen sponge. How do you use it? You simply take the sponge out of the package, wet it under the faucet then squeeze out the excess moisture. Now the sponge is ready to use. You rub it on those black marks on the walls (assuming your paint is washable--some paint like flat or whitewash is not washable.) You can rub it on your baseboards, on your stair railings, chair rails, anywhere you get those annoying black marks and finger smudges. How well does this work? The cashier at the dollar store was right! These ARE amazing. Black nasty marks on the wall along the stairs went in a few swipes. The smudges on the enamel rails and baseboards disappeared with a bit of scrubbing. As you use the sponge, it wears out--literally rubbing away into nothingness. When it's gone, it's gone. Go buy another one. I've had this one for months and it's still going strong. If you have kids, it will probably not last so long. But..who cares? This is a lot better than repainting the wall! I also tried it on carpet--it worked ok, but I prefer carpet cleaner for spot cleaning. It was a champ in the shower stall (the fiberglass floor came up really clean!) Excellent for linoleum or vinyl flooring. Takes off those shoe marks. Where shouldn't I use it? The instructions tell you not to use it on glossy or polished surfaces. Downsides The more you use it (and you WILL) the faster it disintegrates. If you have kids or are a diligent cleaner, it won't last long. You will really see it go down fast if you do a lot of walls. Also, some reports that paint can become discolored or lighter if you scrub on it, so test this in an area where it doesn't show; your paint may react. Summary If you want to remove smudges from your walls and baseboards, cabinets and other painted surfaces, this product is a must-have. It really earns the name Magic Eraser because that is what it does",5.0,positive

6934,"B0000C88FK:cut-throat_razor:william_h._faure_""justlovefaith""","First of all, I don't derive any pleasure from writing bad or negative product reviews. But I'm afraid in this case I have no choice but to voice my opinion of this Remington R-960 electric razor. I have been shaving with electric razors for 30 plus years now. I've used all models of Norelco and Remington triple-header razors over the years as well as Remingtom Micro Screen electric razors (which I currently use). And I'm sorry to have to report that this is probably the worst one I've ever used. (Yes, before you ask,  I do always use a pre-electric shave lotion prior to shaving). The first morning I used this Remington R-960, I felt nothing out of the ordinary. Felt pretty much like any other electric razor. About 15 to 20 minutes after I finished shaving I began to notice a burning-type feeling around my neck/throat area. About an hour later I really felt this burning sensation. I was about to leave for work when I did a quick 'mirror check' in the bathroom and HOLY COW!! My neck and throat area was bright red and all swollen! And I mean BRIGHT RED and SWOLLEN! No wonder the burning sensation I was feeling. I looked like I just finished (trying to) shave with a gas powered hedge trimmer! I got to work and the guys I work with were like ""Holy Crap!! What happened to you?"" ""Why, I just shaved with my brand new Remington R-960 this morning. Why do you ask"", I sarcastically replied. They said it looked like someone took a chain saw to my throat! You get the idea. The bottom line ... it took approximately 6 days for all of the redness and swelling to entirely clear up in my neck/throat area. Needless to say, that morning which was the first time I used my new Remington R-960 electric was also the LAST time I used it. I haven't touched it since. Frankly and if I may be honest here, I'm a little frightened of the thing now. It's like it had a mind of it's own and it bit me but good. Now, each morning when I'm shaving with my Remington MS2-300 Micro Screen (not triple head) razor, I sort of have a tendency to keep one eye on the little monster as it is still sitting there on the shelf near the sink and mirror, patiently waiting for the next time I'm foolish enough to pick it up again.

Since I travel abroad occasionally for work and leisure, it's incredibly helpful to have a charge cord that is ""universal."" Good thinking.Compared to the last Syncro, I noticed that the actual shaving head is more tightly attached to the razor itself. The screen looks (and feels) more durable and comfortable, and the raised ridges along the side of the razor seem to be a bit more pronounced and therefore much easier to grip.The shaver is very easy to clean, and the various settings and adjustments make it incredibly versatile and useful for edging around sideburns and getting those tough spots under your nose and on your neck.

The major omega-3 fatty acids are: ALA, (alpha) linolenic acid EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid DHA, docosahexaenoic acid Supplemental Omega 3 Oils:Many people desire to supplement their omega-3 fatty acid intake with dietary supplements. These supplements generally contain flaxseed oil or fish oil. Flaxseed oil contains alpha-linolenic acid but no EPA and DHA Marine algae sources produce only DHA and no EPA Cold water marine fish oil contains primarily EPA and DHA The preferred form of omega-3 fatty acids is triglycerides from fish oil. It is the most bioavailable form. Another positive about omega-3 fatty acid nutritional supplements is that most of the contaminants, such as harmful PCBs and metals, have been removed during the purification process. Recently, Harvard Medical School researchers studied commercially available omega-3 fish oil supplements and found that they have only ""negligible amounts of mercury"". Further, they state: ""The additional benefit of fatty acids from fish oil is that large doses of Omega-3 fatty acids can be ingested easily in a capsule without the risk of toxicity"".It is important to note that you should always buy omega-3 nutritional supplements with antioxidants. Antioxidants keep your omega-3 supplements fresh and when combined with vitamin E and/or other antioxidants you will decrease or eliminate the incidences of ""fish burps"".Benefits of Omega-3 Oils:Omega-3 fatty acid (oil) supplements may reduce cardiovascular events (death, non-fatal heart attacks, non-fatal strokes) if taken in suficient quantities.  They can also slow the progression of atherosclerosis (hardening of the heart arteries) in coronary patients.  While increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake through foods is preferable, most people may not be able to get enough omega-3 by diet alone.  Thus, folks who are interested in Omega 3 oils may want to talk to their doctor about taking a supplement such as this one.  Supplements may also help people with high triglyceride levelss, who need even larger doses. The benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in cardiovascular disease are so well demonstrated that the American Heart Association has published statements since 1996 recommending increased fish intake and/or omega-3 supplements. In addition, Omega-3 oils help reduce inflammation and are therefore good for those with rheumatism or rheumatoid arthritis.  The standard dose of Omega-3 oils is 1-3 grams per day.  Generally this is 3 tablets, one with each meal.  Jim ""Konedog"" Koeni",5.0,positive

The god-awful razor was actually a good learning experience, because it taught me a few select things:1. I have a hard time keeping a daily shaving routine. I'm always liable to skip a day.2. Wet/dry shaving with an electric is actually better than using a blade.3. NiCd batteries, with their 8-hour recharge time, are a huge annoyance.The Schick (didn't know they made electric razors, did you?) I had couldn't shave my growth if I skipped a day, and my facial hair doesn't even grow all that fast. In addition, in order to properly charge the shaver, I was supposed to completely discharge the shaver, then recharge (presumably to avoid the memory effect of NiCd batteries). Ultimately, this meant one or two shaves out of the week that ended halfway through the process. I went back to using blades for a while. But some unknown force compelled me to peruse the electric shaver section at Fry's one day. After comparing boxes, I settled on this one for $... It was honestly more than I wanted to spend, but I figured I could return it if it didn't measure up.The first shave with the Panasonic proved to me that the whole ""30-day acclimation period"" is crap. This thing worked immediately, fresh out of the box, better than my old shaver ever could. That was dry. Wet shaving, while more involved, shaves much closer while not causing as much irritation. The battery meter is a nice feature, but the kicker is the fast recharge time. Even if the shaver dies, 5-10 minutes is all I need to have it running again. I also don't have to worry about the ""memory effect"" with Ni-MH batteries. The integrated trimmer in between the foils actually works, and means that I actually can shave every-other-day and have it still do its job well. Cleaning involves running it under the faucet with a bit of hand soap.All this said, there are some caveats. Hairs on my neck are still somewhat pesky, and won't go away without a fight. I had to experiment to find the best direction to come at them with the Panasonic. I'm sure more expensive shavers might have an easier time with them.Also, this thing really should come with some sort of stand. It comes with a cloth bag for traveling, but no stand. Get rid of the nose-hair trimmer (which I have no use for) and just give me a basic stand so I have a place to set the shaver to dry.While I could have spent less on a shaver with similar features, I'd be hard pressed to find one at this price that did everything well, without any major annoyances.

7041,500190,"Now that I'm writing this review, it seems silly that I'm so happy over such a small thing as a toothbrush.  But I am.  I bought this item not long after I had my first (and hopefully only) root canal and crown four years ago, something which I never again want to experience in my life (as someone else described, it was painful and expensive).  Growing up, I didn't take care of my teeth like I should've, so I'm accustomed to always being told there's either a cavity, or the start of one, and having to have more work done.  After the root canal, my mom recommended a brush that had at least a certain number of pulsations/oscillations, because that's what she'd been recommended by her dentist to combat her receding gums.  This specific item met those requirements, and it was affordable.  When I first started using it, my gums were very sensitive to it, but that quickly wore off, so it seems to me that it strengthens the gums.  It is also MUCH easier to get behind the front teeth.  Subsequent dentist vists by my mom have shown that her gums have improved dramatically after using a high-quality electric toothbrush such as this one (I honestly don't remember if she has this exact model, but ours are similar), and I've not needed any work done at the dentist beyond regular cleanings since I purchased it.As far as cleaning the unit to keep it from ""gunking"" up, I'm the only person who uses this item, so any extra toothbrush heads are still in the package they came in, not dripping into the storage container; so I don't know how to combat that.

7101,"B0009PD2FQ:an_expensive_form_of_acetaminophen:james_koenig_""konedog4""","Tylenol is an over-the-counter medication that contains as its active ingredient ""Acetaminophen"". Acetaminophen is an analgesic drug that treats mild to moderate pain, making it a great headache reliever, or a medication that treats mild strains, sprains, toothaches, etc. It also acts to reduce fever. Acetaminophen is commonly used in place of aspirin for those allergic to aspirin. One drawback of Acetaminophen is that it does not reduce inflammation (therefore, it has limited use in arthritis swelling reduction). It has few side-effects. Those with liver disease should avoid Acetaminophen, as it is hard on the liver. Tylenol (Acetaminophen) came into great prominence when aspirin fell out of favor due to the incidence of Reye's Syndrome and aspirin in children. Tylenol is the manufacturer's proprietary name for Acetaminophen. There is a generic form of Acetaminophen that is also sold over the counter, and this version is much cheaper than ""Tylenol"", and the container usually contains more tablets/pills, etc. The generic form of Acetaminophen is just as effective as Tylenol, just cheaper priced. Sometimes Acetaminophen is combined with other medications for dual action. For example, Tylenol PM has diphenhydramine (the active ingredient in Benadryl), which causes sedation and acts like a good sleeping pill. Diphenhydramine also is an anti-histamine, so it work for itching and allergies too. Tylenol is packaged in different strengths: Extra-strength at 500 mg per tablet, Standard (325 mg per tablet), and children's dose of 80 mg. Tylenol may also be packaged in a timed-release version, called ""extended release"". Rather than the tablet dissolving all at once in the stomach, the tablet slowly releases acetaminophen throughout the digestive tract. All in all, Acetaminophen is a great product. If you want a ""name brand"" of Acetaminophen, Tylenol is your brand (although it will cost more). My choice is to by the generic brand as it is cheaper by the dozen.

In other words it's not super-sweet but the sucralose (Splenda) gets the job done, if I remember correctly.  It is SUPER for keeping you from getting hungry due to the fact that it has real carbs, not play carbs in it, to match it's high amount of protein - probably could be used for the Zone diet.  You can last hours and hours on it.  It's more than a meal.  (This is NOT a dieter's bar, although with careful planning could be used as such.) We've tried a lot of bars and this is the best high protein bar yet that doesn't rely on sugar alcohols (otherwise, stick to South Beach Diet Bars.",4.0,positive

7152,B0002AHX3A:excellent:philo_vance,"This, obviously, is Waterpik's ""econo"" hand-held showerhead. I have been using their showerheads for at least 15 years, and can see no difference in quality between this one and its higher-priced siblings. Apparently, merely by limiting the number of settings to 3, Waterpik can hold the price down to a fraction of what their more expensive models fetch.For me, its perfect. I noticed with the previous model that I owned, that I used only the regular spray, the pulsating massage and, occasionally, the combination setting. That is precisely what the JM-351 offers. Why pay more for settings I don't use?The regular spray is a pleasant, refreshing ""needle"" type spray that provides a good flow of water even for rinsing shampoo out of hair. The massage provides a forceful pulsation that actually does massage! In fact, it is so forceful that you need to careful where you point it. But for a sore shoulder or a spasming back, its great. The combination setting is continuous - that is, as you rotate the head from spray to massage, you gradually get less spray and more massage.The JM-351 has a curved handle, which is not typical of Waterpiks from what I can tell. This yields one advantage and one disadvantage. Because the handle has a pronounced curve, if you tilt the pivot ball downward, you can get the spray to point straight down. This permits you to easily step out of the water spray while you soap up, shave or whatever. With my old straight-handled model, this was not possible.Unfortunately, the curve also makes the handle slightly less comfortable to hold than if it was straight - especially with soapy, slippery hands. Not a big problem, but noticeable enough to make it worth mentioning.Installation hint: Waterpik is very good about maintaining the same size fittings and thread sizes across their entire line and over time. If you are replacing an existing Waterpik, you can replace just the hose and handle, while continuing to use the existing pivot ball and bracket. In fact, if your current hose is in good condition, you could replace just the handle. A 30-second installation!My only (minor) complaint is that after 2 months and 60 hot showers, the hose has not completely relaxed. It still sort of ""sticks out"" instead of just dangling limply from the bracket the way the old one did. I expect that eventually this will happen.If you are not a ""style-monster"" who requires a more elegantly appointed showerhead, and if you need only the basic spray and massage patterns, this is your showerhead.

(The new Norelcos have the similar problems - look and feel cheap. Far less solid than my old faithful Quadra. Braun and Panasoic feel better build. Brauns are pleasure to my eyes and hands. But unfortunately, no one shaves as close as Remington)And it's a shaver after all and it supposes to shave.

7181,"B000GGTSGK:its_a_little_noisy,_but_works_well_--_its_not_a_gimmick.:s._bunker","My initial impression after using it for two days now is favorable. My gums have bled a lot, but that might be because I've never brushed my teeth this insanely till now.I believe the manufacturer claim that you 'can brush in 40 seconds' is fairly accurate, here's why: Because it uses 6 brush surfaces at a time (instead of 1 in a regular toothbrush), it truly IS a time saver in that respect. You certainly feel like you are geting more out of your typical 1 minute brushing that you ever did before. Someone was really thinking outside the box when they designed this thing.The big advantage to this product (to me), is that you still only spend 40 second to 1 minute per brushing ... vs. 3 minutes+ for a product like the sonicare.  I just didn't see myself making the commitment and keeping to it over the long haul (just being realistic).  Also, this product requires very little skill to properly position (just bit down, hold hydrabrush with two fingers, so it can self-pivot ... whereas sonicare and other electric brushes require 30 seconds per quadrant and you must be skilled enough to aim it and angle it ... sure, not hard, but if your using bad technique, then yours also not doing a good job.I did accidently run it on high the first time, before I realized that low was the second click over, not the first click over, which seems kind of counter-intuitive to me. I should have looked at the unit closer, as it shows ""2 dots"" (for fast) and shows ""1 dot"" (for slow) ... they tried, but I still got it wrong somehow. As a result of my first use and the high setting, my rear gums bled a lot.  This was documented in the instruction and seem normal (to bleed the first few days).I think the fast speed will ultimately be what I want to use, but slow is nearly as effective and still quite a workout for the teeth and gums. Clearly, slow is best for newbies like myself. As I write this, I can still feel my gums and they feel like they got quite a workout.The brush unit itself is quite big, but the brushes were smaller than expected, which was a good thing. The pictures online made these brushes appear to be quite huge and I wondered how I'd have room for it all in my mouth. Some people with small mouths might potentially have an issue using the hydrabrush. Some people with small hands might potentially find holding it a bit cumbersome. It works fine for me, despite the large size. My kids saw me using it today after work and they were like ""wow dad, thats cool"" ... ""it looks like it does a REALLY good job!"".I had read that the brushes were not easy to put on and take off -- but it seems fairly easy, not really hard. I wouldn't want to share an electric toothbrush with anyone in the first place! I took them off to clean off the brushes a little better, so I removed the brushes by pressing in a small metal pin on each brush head (there are two brush heads totaland pull) and pulling each one out -- not hard to do if you ask me. Putting them back on was simply: push on, click ... its on, then repeat for second head.I worry a litle about the dual motors holding up over time. It seems like the motors almost bog down at times on my rear molars, esp. on the low speed ... but it DOES keep going. You can bite down a little less and it seems to relieve the motor strain somewhat.  I've noticed this is mainly only observed after a week of use.  Fully charged, it's a powerhouse.I'm trying to see how many days it'll last on a single charge. So far, two days and still going strong. Its doing a lot of work, so I perhaps worry that the batteries won't last long.I will say that it ""feels"" like I just got out of a dental cleaning, for the most part. You know, its a good, clean feeling -- but also one where you feel a bit abused. My teeth and gums feels pretty beaten up in just 1 minute. I will say that I perceive the 1 minute brush time to be VERY effective, based on how clean it feels after such a short period of brushing. It feels like a brushed a LOT longer than I did.I hope my gums get used to this and stop bleeding in a few more days. The bleeding never lasts long, which I think is a good sign.I read somewhere that this toothbrush is not waterproof, and that appears to be true, as it came with a 'water shield' to go around the brush unit, just below where the brushes attach. This seems to work pretty well and it doesn't seem to come loose. So far, the unit is staying dry with little to no extra effort on my part.  I don't really use the included holder or case, I just set the unit on the side of the sink (on a small washcloth) so it can drip dry into the sink.  Thats just me.The unit charges overnight and they tell you not to overcharge it beyond that. It blinks while charging and then stops after its charged. THey says its good for something like 40 uses, which I'll be surprised if thats true. I'd be happy if it lasted for 20 1 minutes sessions. I've used it 5 times thus far.Using the hydrabrush consists of holding the unit with two fingers (loosely) and then biting down somewhat on the brushes and letting it glide down your teeth somewhat on its own. You do push and pull it along somewhat, but you don't have to angle or work on brushing technique at all. This is truly a gadget which could turn us all into brushing idiots. This is quite strange, but seems to be pretty easy to do and it's hard to imagine people having a hard time using it, after adjusting to its strangeness.The small amount of toothpaste I put into each brush seems to get stuck and does take a little extra cleaning to remove after brushing. Maybe I'm not putting in on right. The owners manual makes it sound like toothpaste is 'optional' -- strange.The feeling I get after using the hydrabrush is -- ""wow, my teeth feel really clean"". I don't think my back molars have ever been brushed with this much vigor before. I guess the real test will be (the comments I get) at my next dentist appointment. Update: bleeding of gums has long since stopped and the hydrabrush is still going strong on the original (first) charge. I'm very impressed with the brush, as it appears to be doing a good job with my teeth. I'm hoping for a good comment from my dental hygienist on my next visit. I've also been using the Waterpik ... and its also a very good product. No, I haven't tried the extra reach brushes. Since my teeth were badly worn down by childhood grinding, I fugured my teeth were too short to require those brush heads. I think I'm getting plenty of coverage with the basic heads, but I could see how people with better teeth (taller teeth) could require the extra reach heads.The hydrabrush did finally run out of power from the initial charge -- and I would say I got a good 2 weeks on the charge, if not more.One minor concern that has come up after using the hydrabrush, is the amount of noise it makes, esp. when using at bedtime, when others might already be asleep.  It gets louder the more drained the batteries get, so it might be more of a motor strain noise than anything.  I've noticed fully charged batteries are more quiet.I'm still impressed with how good this makes my teeth feel after only 1 minute of brushing. I believe its about time I write a review for amazon, not that I've had some time to use this product.I would add that the hydrabrush would probably not be so great for little kids, since the brush itself is quite big and might be too much for a little pallete, with little teeth. Probably ages 10+ would be appropriate.Update: I have since switched to the high speed setting.  I would also say that (for me) this product, like a water pik, can be a tad messy and requires you brush over the sink, so that water and toothpaste can drop into it while brushing.  It's not a major amount, but I do find that a controlled 'drool' while brushing is almost necessary, unless you stop in the middle.  I just drool and complete it in 1 minutes or less. I do advise using the included rubber (waterproof sheath) that is included, as it keeps the water from running down onto the handle while in use.  Since the unit is not fully waterproof, using this is mandatory in my mind.I had to buy this to see if this device was ""for real"", or just another infomercial gimmick ... but I'll say, it's for real ... and if you go into it with an open mind and some flexibility for a little noise and mess ... this will really do a nice job on your teeth.The replacement heads are cheaper than sonicare as well.

I found that if you use the same brush over and over the single row of bristles seems to splay (spread out) and not able to get under the nails as when new.Since we have them placed in the kitchen and 2 bathrooms I found that the less used ones seem to stay in better shape.  I ended up purchasing 6 more when Amazon.com had them for sale recently (with free shipping this time) and hope that alternating use of more than one will cause a better lifespan,4.0,positive

Every parent should have a subscription to diapers and wipes, they come every 30,60, or 90 days.

7188,323254,"LCD fell off when arrived because the two-side sticker wasn't stong enough. Anyhow,I could push it back. Then, the scale couldn't be turned on by tapping on the top. This is the only way you can make this scale work as discribed on manual. I have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime! I think some force sensor attached to the frame is broken. This is the problem I can't fix.  The only thing I can do is sending it back. Following up: According to the other review, I tried to make this scale ""vibrating"" using different ways of tapping. It didn't work no matter how hard I tried. I had to use my toe to lift up one side a little (about half an inch) and drop it on hard floor to make enough ""vibration"" to turn it on. I wonder how long this scale can function well by such a way to switch on. My Soehnle scale always turns on by a soft tapping. I have to admit the reading of this scale is very clear and accurate.

Amazon, of course, also offers free shipping for $25 or more, so I bought 3 and got them all shipped free! Great deal! And, by the way, it IS incredible!

7195,"B000FED5DU:looks_cheap..._and_is_in_fact,_cheap:nicholas_masterson","I bought this a while back and began finding problems with it right away.1) The trimmer cannot operate on A/C power alone.  This means you can't plug it into the wall and use it.  Instead, you have to charge the battery, then unplug it to use it.2) About 2 weeks after I bought it, the beard trimmer attachment broke.  The little tabs that hold it at different lengths snapped off so you can only use it on the shortest setting, and you have to hold the attachment on with your hand so it won't slide off.  Clearly, I'm not the only one who this has happened to.3) The nose trimmer has very dull blades. I don't normally use a nose trimmer nor do I really need one, but I have a cheap one that I got in my Christmas stocking that I've used a few times.  Out of curiosity, I tried the attachment that came with this trimmer and was introduced to a new kind of pain.  It was pulling at the hairs but not cutting them.I contacted the a representative at Norelco to see if I they would send me a replacement beard attachment or if I could purchase just that attachment.  They directed me to their service centers who wanted $10 for just that attachment.  Including shipping, it would have cost me almost what I payed for the whole set.My advice:  pay a little more for something sturdier.  That's what I plan on doing",1.0,negative

7200,49390,"Outstanding quality, consistency and accuracy!  At the end of the day that is all you can ask from a blood pressure cuff (sphygmomanometer).  A few things to bear in mind:  In consecutive readings done at the same time, you will see a trend from higher to lower blood pressure as you ""learn"" to lower your own pressure.  Also, your blood pressure at home will be lower than that you obtain at your doctor's office until you learn to overcome the anxiety normally associated with the doctor's office.  This is normal and is one of the main reasons to obtain a home blood pressure monitor.  Also, your pressure will fluctuate from day to day and even during a blood pressure monitoring session.  So don't automatically assume that the gauge is not giving accurate readings!  Trust me, it is.This monitor has been extensively tested against measurements obtained at the doctor's office and has been determined to be as accurate a method of determining blood pressure as you would obtain at the doctor's office - actually, more accurate since the anxiety factor is eliminated.  So if you are looking for the best home blood monitor device on the market look no further.  Just made sure and trust it!I heartily endorse this product",5.0,positive
